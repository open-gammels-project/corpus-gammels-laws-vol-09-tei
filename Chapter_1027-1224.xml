<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That Ar<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ticle 426 of the Revised Civil Statutes be so amended as hereafter to read as follows:</p>
<p>Article 426. Cities having more than ten thousand inhabitants may levy, assess, and collect taxes not exceeding one and one-half per cent on the assessed value of real and personal estate and property in the city, not exempt from taxation by the constitution and laws of the state, and assessments, levy, and collection of taxes made by such cities for the year 1889 are hereby made valid to the amount aforesaid, and such cities are hereby authorized to levy, assess, and collect a further tax of twenty-five cents on the one hundred dollars worth of property for the purpose of paying the debts of such city lawfully contracted prior to the first day of January, 1889, not to include any bonded debt. Any funding warrants that may be issued for such debt by any such city shall not be included in the limit of six per cent prescribed by Article 420: Provided, That this act shall not apply to or in any manner affect any city organized under a special charter, and shall not be construed to validate any debt contracted by any city without authority of law existing at the time the same was contracted.</p>
<p>Sec. 2.

<p>Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas:</p>

The provisions of this article shall not apply to or in any manner affect railway companies incorporated for the construction and operation of urban, suburban, and belt railroads for a distance of less than ten miles, as provided in clause two of section one of this act: Provided, That all such companies shall, within twelve months from the date of their charter, complete a portion of their road and commence and continue the running of cars thereon.</p>

<salute>An Act to amend Articles 4742 and 4743 of the Revised Statutes of the State of Texas, and to add thereto another article to be known as Article 4743a.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That Articles 4742 and 4743 of the Revised Statutes of the State of Texas be so amended, and that Article 4743a be added thereto, so that hereafter the same shall read as follows:</p>
<p>Article 4742. At the end of each quarter the collector of taxes shall, on forms to be furnished him by the comptroller of public accounts, make a report under oath to the comptroller of all taxes collected by him for the state every three months. The first report shall include the months of October, November, and December; the second shall include the months of January, February, and March; the third shall include the months of April, May, and June; and the fourth shall include the months of July, August, and September, of each year; and he shall make like reports to the commissioners court of all taxes collected for the county. He shall file such reports, together with the tax receipt stubs and a tame copy of his report to the comptroller, in the office of the county clerk. At the time of filing such reports the collector of taxes shall pay any balance in his hands due the county to the county treasurer, and remit any balance due the state to the state treasurer. The couny clerk shall, within five days, examine the said reports and stubs, and if the reports and stubs agree in every particular as regards names, dates, and amounts, he, the clerk, shall certify to their correctness; but if they do not agree in any particular, he shall so certify. He, the clerk, shall then forward tire report intended for the comptroller, with his certificate thereon, to such officer, and file the true copy thereof with the tax receipt stubs and the report intended for the commissioners court in his office.</p>
<p>Article 4743. it shall be the duty of the commissioners court, at its next regular session after the filing of any report provided for in the foregoing article, to examine such reports and compare the same with the tax rolls and tax receipt stubs and with the receipts and vouchers accompanying the same, and the collector of taxes shall appear before said commissioners court at such regular terms, and make a full statement of all taxes and money, both of the county and state, collected by him during the three months covered by such report. If any mistake is discovered in any such report, the commissioners court shall correct the same. If the collector of taxes is found to be still due the state or county for taxes collected during such quarter, he shall immedi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="1059" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="31" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>ately pay to the county treasurer the amount due the county, and file a proper receipt therefor with the county clerk, and remit to the state treasurer the amount due the state, and file with such clerk a voucher showing that he has done so. When such reports are found to be correct, and the tax collector has paid to the county and state treasurer the full amount due the state and county respectively, the commissioners court shall enter an order approving said reports, with the order approving the same shall be recorded in the minutes as other proceedings of said court.</p>
<p>Article 4743a. If any collector of taxes shall have failed to pay over to the county treasurer the amount due by him to the county, or remit to the state treasurer the amount due the state, before the next term, of the commissioners court after the filing of his reports as provided in the foregoing article, or shall, during such term, fail or refuse to pay or remit the same and file proper vouchers therefor as provided in said article, the commissioners court shall not approve his reports, but such court shall ascertain the amount due by him both to the county and state, and enter an order requiring him to pay the same to the proper treasurer, as is provided in Article 4769a, Section 2, of the Revised Statutes, and notify such collector to account as is provided for in Article 4769a, Section 3.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. The fact that there is now no adequate law providing for settle<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment with tax collectors, and the near approach of the end of the session, creates an emergency and an imperative public necessity requiring the sus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pension of the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days be suspended and this act take effect from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

<p>Whereas many deeds to land are imperfect in that they do not give the abstract numbers or the original headlight surveys correctly; and whereas many real estate owners have heretofore rendered and paid taxes upon their lands in this state under an incorrect abstract number or headlight survey, or as unknown, the result of said erroneous rendition of lands for taxes being that in many instances the true headlight surveys have been sold to the state for taxes when in fact the taxes due on said lands had previous to such tax sale been paid in full by the owners thereof: Therefore,</p>

<p>Whereas many deeds to land are imperfect in that they do not give abstract numbers, and many tracts have been erroneously sold for taxes, and the law pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vides no method for correcting such mistakes, therefore an emergency exists which requires that the constitutional rule requiring that bills be read on three several occasions be suspended and that this act take effect from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That the boundary lines of Brewster, Jeff Davis, Buchel, and Foley counties are hereby es<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tablished and defined as follows:</p>
<p>A. The county of Brewster is bounded, as follows: Beginning at the southeast corner of survey No. 36, certificate No. 3376, G. C. and S. F. By.

<p>B. The county of Jeff Davis is hounded as follows: Beginning at the northwest corner of Brewster County, the southeast corner of, survey No. 36,<pb n="1073" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="45" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>certificate No. 3376, G. C. &#38; S. E. Ry. Co.; thence northwest to the northeast corner of survey No. 54, certificate No. $$$, T. &#38; P. Ry. Co., block No. 1; thence west to the northeast corner of survey No. 117, certificate No. $$$, H. &#38; T. C. Ry. Co., block No. 4; thence north to the southeast corner of survey No. 127, certificate No. $$$, &#38; T. C. Ry. Co., block No. 4; thence west to the southeast corner of El Paso County, on the Rio Grande; thence north along the east line of El Paso County to the corner of El Paso and Reeves counties; thence in a southeast direction along the former north boundary line of Presidio County to the northeast comer of Brewster County; thence along the north boundary line of Brewster County in a westwardly course to the place of beginning.</p>
<p>C. Buchel county is bounded as follows: Beginning at the northeast corner of Brewster County on the Presidio and Pecos County line; thence south with the east line of Brewster County sixty miles; thence east to the Rio Grande; thence down said river with its meanders to the Pecos County line; thence in a north<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />westerly direction along said Pecos County line to the place of beeinning.</p>
<p>D.

<p>Sec. 2. Whereas in the creation of the counties of Brewster and Jeff Davis, and fixing their boundaries, they were placed within less than twelve miles of Marfa, the county seat of Presidio County, the county from which they were taken, this creates a doubt as to their constitutionality; therefore an imperative necessity is created, and an emergency exists for the suspension of the constitutional rule re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quiring bills to be read on three several days, and said rule is suspended, it is so enacted, and that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

<p>Section 1.

<p>Section 2. Any person who is the owner or part owner of any fences connected with or adjoined to any fences owned in part or in whole by any other person, shall have the right to withdraw or separate his fence or part of fence from the fence of any other person or persons in this state; that such person who desires to withdraw or separate such fence from the fence of any other person shall give notice in writing to such person, his agent, attorney, or lessee, of his intention to separate or withdraw his fence or part thereof for at least six months prior to the time of such intended withdrawal or separation. Any person failing to comply with the provisions of this section shall be fined in any sum not less than two dollars nor more than fifty dollars, and every ten days shall constitute a sep<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />arate offense for the violation of this act.</p>
<p>Section 3. That any person who is the owner of any fence wholly upon his own land to which the fence of another is adjoined or connected in any manner, may require the owner of any such fence to disconnect and withdraw the same back on his own land by first giving notice in writing for at least six months to such person, his agent, attorney, or lessee, to disconnect and withdraw his fence back on his own land. That any person who shall negligently or wilfully fail to disconnect his fence and remove the same back upon his own land after the expiration of said notice, shall be fined in any sum not less than ten nor more than fifty dollars, and each ten days failure after such notice shall constitute a separate offense for the violation of the provisions of this act.</p>
<p>Sec. 4 [2]. Whereas an early adjournment of this session renders it impossible for bills to be read on three several days, therefore an emergency exists and an imperative public necessity demands that the rule requiring bills to be read on three several days be suspended, and that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

If upon the first day of August of any year the interest due on any obligation remains unpaid, the purchaser shall have until the first day of the following January in which to pay said interest, and for said default said purchaser shall pay fifty per cent penalty on said interest then past due; and if said purchaser shall fail to pay said past due interest and penalty on or before said first day of January, the commissioner of the general land office shall en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dorse on such obligation &#8220;land forfeited,&#8221; and shall cause an entry to that effect to be made on the account kept with the purchaser, and thereupon said land shall be forfeited to the state without the necessity of re-entry or judicial ascertain<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment, and shall revert to the particular fund to which it originally belonged and be resold under the provisions of this act or any future law: Provided, if any pur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />chaser shall die, his heirs or legal representatives shall have one year in which to make payment after the first day of August next after such death. And if any purchaser shall fail to reside upon and improve in good faith the land purchased by him he shall forfeit said land and all payments made thereon to the state in the same manner as for non-payment of interest, and such land shall be again for sale as if no such sale and forfeiture had occurred; or if he shall fail to make the proof of occupancy within the time and in the manner prescribed by the regulations of the commissioner of the general land office, as provided for in sec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion 9 of this act, he shall in like manner forfeit the land and all payments thereon to the state: Provided further, That nothing in this section contained shall be construed to inhibit the state from instituting such legal proceedings as may be necessary to enforce such forfeiture or to protect any other right to such land, which suits may be instituted by the attorney-general, under the directions of the governor, in the proper court of the county in which the land lies or in the district court of Travis County, and jurisdiction of such cases is hereby expressly conferred on said courts: Provided, This section shall be printed on the back of receipt.</p>

Such timber shall not be sold for less than five dollars per acre cash, except in such cases as the commissioner may ascertain by definite examination of a state agent that any particular section is sparsely timbered or contains timber of but little value, in which case he shall be authorized to sell the timber on said sec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion at the best price, on the best terms practicable: Provided, Such timber is sold at not less than two dollars per acre. And in no case shall less than one section of timbered land be sold to any purchaser, except in cases of fractional sections which may be sold under the provisions of this act. The purchaser shall have five years from the date of his purchase within which to remove the timber there<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />from, and in case of failure to do so such timber shall be forfeited to the state without judicial ascertainment: Provided, That all timbered lands from which the timber has been cut and taken off may be placed on the market and sold for not less than two dollars per acre, as other lands are sold under the provisions of this act.</p>
<p>Section 14. The public lands, and all lands belonging to the public free schools, asylums, or university fund, shall be leased by the commissioner of the general land office in accordance with the provisions of this act. All of such lands lying north of the Texas and Pacific Railroad and east of the Pecos River shall be leased for a period not longer than six years, except as hereinafter provided; and all lands lying south of the Texas and Pacific Railroad, and all lands west of the Pecos River, and all university lands, and all lying in the counties of Andrews, Gaines, Terry, and Yoakum, shall be leased for a period not longer than ten years, and the lessee shall pay an annual rental of four cents per acre for all lands leased.

All leases shall be executed under the hand and seal of the commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioner of the general land office, and shall be delivered to the lessee or his duly authorized agent, and such lease shall not take effect until the first annual rent is paid and the lease duly filed for record in the county where the land lies or to which it may be attached for judicial purposes, and it shall not be necessary for the commissioner to acknowledge such lease before the same is placed on record.</p>
<p>Section 15. Any person desiring to lease any portion of the public lands be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />longing to the several funds mentioned in this act, shall make application in writ<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing to the commissioner of the general land office, specifying and describing the particular lands he desires to lease; thereupon the commissioner, if satisfied that the lands applied for are not in immediate demand for purposes of actual settlement, and that such lands can be leased without detriment to the public interest, shall notify the applicant in writing that his proposition to lease is accepted; and thereupon he shall execute and deliver to the lessee, in the name and by the authority of the state, a lease of said land for such term as may be agreed upon, and deliver the same to such lessee when satisfied that the lessee has paid to the treasurer of the state the rent for one year in advance. No lands classified as grazing land under this act shall be subject to sale during the existence of such lease, and the possession thereof by the lessee shall not be disturbed during the term of such lease so long as the rents are paid promptly in advance each year as required by this act.</p>
<pb n="1081" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="53" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>
<p>The land classified as agricultural land, which may be leased under this act, shall be leased subject to sale as provided by this act; and whenever such leased land may be purchased, the lessee shall give immediate possession to such purchaser: Provided, That the lessee shall have a pro rate credit upon his next year&#8217;s rent or the money refunded to him by the treasurer, as he may elect: Provided further, That no such sale shall be permitted where such lessee shall have previously placed improvements of the value of one hundred dollars upon such section of lands sought to be purchased. That no purchaser or other person than the lessee shall be permitted to turn loose within such leasehold more than one head of horses, mules, or cattle, for every ten acres of land purchased, owned, or controlled by him and unenclosed, or in lieu thereof four head of sheep or goats to every ten acres of land so purchased, owned, or controlled and unenclosed. Each violation of the provisions of this act which restricts the number of stock that may be turned loose on lands leased from the state, shall be an offense, and the offender on conviction shall be punished by fine of not less than one dollar for each head of stock he may so turn loose, and each thirty days violation of the provisions of this section shall constitute a separate offense.</p>
<p>Section 22. The commissioner of the general land office, under the direction of the governor, may withhold from lease any agricultural lands necessary for pur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />poses of settlement, and no agricultural land[s] shall be leased if in the judg<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of the commissioner they may be in immediate demand for settlement, but such lands shall be held for settlement, and sold to actual settlers only, under the provisions of this act, and all sections or fraction of sections in all counties or<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ganized prior to the first day of January, 1875, except El Paso, Pecos, and Pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sidio counties, which sections are detached and isolated from other public lands, may be sold to any purchaser, except to a corporation, without actual settlement, at not less than two dollars per acre, upon such terms as the commissioner of the general land office may prescribe.</p>

Said clerk shall enter in a book, to be kept for that purpose, the names of the plaintiffs and de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fendants in attachment, the amount of the debt, and the return of the officer in full. Should the writ of attachment be quashed or otherwise vacated, the court in which the attachment suit is pending shall cause a certified copy of said order to be sent to the county clerk of the county or counties in which the real estate levied upon is situated. Said clerk shall, upon the receipt of the same, enter in the book aforesaid the names of the plaintiffs and defendants and record the order of the court in full. If the real estate levied upon is situated in any county other than the one in which the suit is pending, then, in case of failure to make the record aforesaid, the attachment lien shall not be valid against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice and subsequent lien-holders in good faith. The county clerk of every county in this state shall keep a well bound book for the record of the matters aforesaid, and shall keep a direct and reverse index thereto, in which shall be entered the names of all the plaintiffs and defendants in the various attachments recorded by him, and the order of the court aforesaid shall be indexed in the same manner, and certified copies of such records shall be admissible in lieu of the original writ and entries. Clerks of the county court shall receive the same fees for recording the matter herein<pb n="1109" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="81" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>provided for as they are now allowed by law for recording deeds, to be paid by plaintiff, and said fees to be taxed as a part of the costs in the case in which the attachment is issued and paid and collected as other costs. Sheriffs shall receive a fee of one dollar for making the copy and return herein pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided for, to be taxed and collected as other costs in the suit.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. The near approach of the close of this session of the legislature and the fact that no law of the kind now exists on our statute books, creates an imperative public necessity and an emergency authorizing the suspension of the constitutional rule which requires bills to be read on three several days, and the said rule is suspended.</p>

<p>Sec. 2. That said bonds shall be of such denomination as the governor may direct, and shall be redeemable at the pleasure of the state, and shall bear interest at the rate of five per centum per annum, payable annually at the state treasury on the first day of March of each year.</p>

</opener>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That the county commissioners court of any county in this state is hereby authorized and empowered to compromise, compound, settle with, and to fund any existing in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />debtedness lawfully made and undertaken by such county by authority of law created prior to January 1, 1889, and for this purpose the said commissioners courts are hereby authorized and empowered to issue bonds in denominations of not less than five hundred dollars, with interest coupons payable annually, said bonds to become due and payable in twenty years from the date of their issu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ance: Provided, That said bonds may be paid off at any time after two years from the date of their issuance if the commissioners court should so elect: And provided further, That such bonds shall not be sold for less than their face or par value; said bonds to bear interest not exceeding six per cent per annum. And the said commissioners courts are further authorized and empowered to levy a tax upon all real and personal property situated in the county, not to exceed twenty-five cents on the hundred dollars on the assessed value of such property in any one year, to pay the annual interest and not less than two per cent annually of the principal of said bonds, beside the expenses of assessing and collecting the same; and no bonds shall be issued under this act until a levy, as herein provided, shall have been made, and when said levy shall have been so made, the same shall continue in force until the whole amount of the principal and interest shall have been fully paid: Provided, That nothing herein shall be construed to authorize any county to levy any tax in excess of that authorized by the constitution and the laws now in force: Provided further, That it shall not authorize the taking up of bonds heretofore issued, and issuing new bonds in lieu thereof.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. All taxes levied under this act shall be applied solely to the objects for which they were levied, as follows:</p>
<p>1. To the payment of the expenses of assessing and collecting the same.</p>
<p>2. To the payment of the annual interest of said bonds and not less than two per cent of the principal; and if there be any excess on hand, after making the above payments for the current year, it shall be used in the purchase and can<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cellation of said bonds, after the expiration of said five years, as hereinbefore pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. All taxes levied under this act shall be assessed and collected in the same manner and by the same officers whose duty it is to assess and collect the state tax, and they shall receive for their services one-fourth the rate of commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sions allowed for assessing and collecting the state tax. The same remedies shall be used to enforce the collection of said taxes that are provided by law to enforce the collection of the state tax: Provided, That such taxes shall be assessed and collected separately from that levied, assessed, and collected for current expenses of municipal government, and shall, when levied, specify in the act of levying the purpose therefor.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. The officer whose duty it is to collect the taxes levied under this act shall give a bond, with two or more sufficient sureties to be approved by the county commissioners court, in a sum to be equal to double the estimated<pb n="1118" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="90" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>annual amount of said tax, which bond shall be payable to the county, and shall be conditioned for the faithful collection and payment of said tax into the county treasury.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. It shall be the duty of the county treasurer to receive all moneys col<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lected under this act, and to keep separate accounts thereof, and to pay out the same on warrants drawn by the order of the commissioners court in the usual regular form.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. The collector of the taxes levied under this act shall pay over to the county treasurer, at the beginning of each and every month, all moneys he may have collected during the next preceding month, deducting his legal commission on the amount so paid, and he shall, at each regular meeting of the county com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioners court, make a report of his collections and payments to the county treasurer since the next preceding term.</p>
<p>Sec. 7.

<p>Sec. 9.

<p>Sec. 16. The near approach of the close of this session of the legislature, and the fact that the present law creating and governing the house of correction and reformatory is inadequate, creates an emergency and imperative public necessity that the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days be suspended, and it is so enacted, and this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage.</p>

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That the unappropriated waters of every river or natural stream within the arid portions of the state of Texas, in which, by reason of the insufficient rainfall, irrigation is necessary for agricultural purposes, may be diverted from its natural channel for irrigation, domestic, and other beneficial uses: Provided, That said water shall not be diverted so as to deprive any person who claims, owns, or holds a possessory right or title to any land lying along the bank or margin of any river or natural stream of the use of the water thereof for his own domestic use.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. That the unappropriated waters of every river or natural stream within the arid portions of the state, as described in the preceding section of this act, are hereby declared to be the property of the public, and may be ac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quired by appropriation for the uses and purposes as hereinafter provided.</p>

<p>Sec. 4. As between appropriators, the one first in time is the one first in right to such quantity of the water only as is reasonably sufficient and necessary to irrigate the land susceptible of irrigation on either side of ditch or canal.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. Every person, corporation, or association of persons which have con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />structed or may hereafter construct any ditch, canal, or reservoir, for the purposes named in this act, and taking water from any natural stream, shall, within ninety days after this act goes into effect, or within ninety days after the commencement of such construction, file and cause to be recorded in the office of the county clerk of the county where the head gate of such ditch or canal may be situated, or to which said county may be attached for judicial purposes, in a well bound book to be kept by said clerk for that purpose, a sworn statement in writing, showing the name of such ditch or canal, the point at which the head gate thereof is situated, the size of the ditch or carnal in width and depth, and the carrying capacity thereof in cubic feet per second of time, the name of said stream from which said water is taken, the time when the work was commenced, and the name of the owners or owner thereof, together with a map showing the route of said ditch or canal.</p>

<p>Sec. 15. Any corporation created and organized under the provisions of the general laws of this state or the provisions of this act for the purpose of irrigation, shall have the power to acquire lands by voluntary donation or purchase or in payment of stock or water rights, and to hold and dispose of all such lands and other property, and to borrow money for the construction, maintenance, and operation of its canals, ditches, flumes, feeders, reservoirs, and wells, and may issue bonds and mortgage its corporate property and fran<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />chises to secure the payment of any debt contracted for the same: Provided, All lands acquired by said corporation, except such as are used for the<pb n="1131" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="103" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>construction, maintenance, and operation of said canals, ditches, laterals, feeders, reservoirs, and wells shall be alienated within twenty years from the date of acquiring said lands or be subject to judicial forfeiture.</p>
<p>Sec. 16. All laws and parts of laws in conflict with the provisions of this act are hereby repealed.</p>

D.): Provided, however, That a substantial compliance with the above form shall be deemed sufficient to fix and secure the lien.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. In case the contract is filed and recorded as provided for in the second section of this act, a like description of the house, building, or improvement and the lot or tract of land shall accompany the same as is required in the foregoing forms, except that the same is not required to be under oath.</p>
<p>Sec. 7.

<p>Sec. 14. In all cases when a lien shall be filed under a provision of this act, by any person other than the original contractor or builder, it shall be the duty of the original contractor to defend any action brought thereupon, at his own expense, and during the pending of such action, the owner may withhold from the contractor or builder the amount of money for which such lien shall be filed, and in case of judgment against the owner or his property upon the lien, he shall be entitled to deduct from any amount due by him to the contractor the amount of said judgment and costs, and if he shall have settled with the contractor or builder in full, he shall be entitled to recover back from the contractor any amount so paid by the owner for which the contractor or builder was originally the party liable. But no owner or proprietor shall in any case be required to pay, nor his property be liable for any money that he may have paid to the contractor before the fixing of the lien or before he has received written notice of the existence of the debt, and all subcontractors, laborers, and material men shall have preference over other creditors of the principal contractor or builder: Provided further, A copy of each bill of lumber furnished to the contractor or builder, as the same is furnished, shall be delivered to the owner of said homestead, said bill specify<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="1142" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="114" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>ing each item so furnished, how much is paid thereon, and what is due for lum<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ber or material furnished for said contract prior thereto: Provided, When the debt is paid under the contract for such building or improvements, the party for whose interest the contract was recorded shall enter a relinquishment showing a full compliance of said contract to the extent of all money due them from the original contractor or builder on account of labor done or material furnished, and the money due said original contractor or builder from the person owning or having improvements made shall not be garnisheed by other creditors to the prejudice of such subcontractors, mechanics, laborers, or material men.</p>

<p>Sec. 17. The lien created by this act shall cease to be operative after twelve months after the same is fixed, unless suit is brought within said time to enforce such lien.</p>

<p>Sec. 19. All laws and parts of laws in conflict with, the provisions of this act be and the same are hereby repealed.</p>
<p>Sec. 20. It being important that the benefits of this act be realized at once, because the parties to be benefited by this act have no adequate protection under existing laws, creates an emergency and an imperative necessity that the consti<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days should be suspended, and this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That the owner or keeper of any stallion, jack, or bull, who keeps the same confined for the purpose of standing them for profit, shall have a preference lien upon the progeny of such stallion, jack, or bull, to secure the payment of the amount due such owner or keeper for services of such stallion, jack, or bull, and such lien may be foreclosed in the same manner as other mortgage liens upon personal property in this state: Provided, That where parties misrepresent their stock by false pedigree no lien shall obtain.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. The lien herein provided for shall remain in force for the period of twelve months from the birth of said progeny, but shall not be enforced until six months shall have elapsed after such birth.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. In order to fix and secure the lien provided for the owner or keeper shall have the right at any time within sixty days after such service by such stallion, jack, or bull is rendered, to file his contract in the office of the county clerk of the county of the residence of the person benefited by such service, and cause the same to be recorded in a book kept by the clerk for that purpose, and said clerk shall be allowed a fee of twenty cents for recording such contract.</p>

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That all the public schools, university, asylum, and public lands containing valuable mineral deposits are hereby reserved from sale or other disposition, except as herein pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided, and are declared free and open to exploration and purchase under regula<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions prescribed by law by citizens of the United States and those who have de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />clared their intention of becoming such: Provided, That all who have located and recorded claims under previous laws and have not abandoned same, but are engaged in developing same, shall have a prior preference right for thirty days after the passage of this act in which to relocate same under this act.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. It shall be the duty of the commissioner of the general land office im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mediately upon the passage of this act to have a map made showing the loca<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion of all public school, university, asylum, and public lands which are unsold at that date; and it shall be the dirty of the geological and mineralogical survey to examine all such lands as soon as practicable thereafter, and to designate such tracts as are apparently mineral bearing as mineral lands for the purposes of this act.

<p>Sec. 3. It shall be the duty of the commissioner of the general land office to unite a suitable number of these mineral locations into mining districts, in each of which shall be a surveyor who must either be the surveyor of the district or county or a regularly appointed deputy, and an officer qualified to administer oaths.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. A mining claim upon veins or lodes of quartz or other rocks in places bearing silver, cinnabar, lead, tin, copper, or other valuable metals, excluding de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />posits of iron ore, coal, kaolin, baryta, salt, marble, fire clays, valuable building stones, oil, or natural gas, may equal but shall not exceed one thousand five hun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dred feet along the vein or lode.

<p>Sec. 5. The locators of any mining claim shall post up at the center of one of the end lines of the same a written notice stating the name of the locator and of the claim, and the date of posting, and describe the claim by giving the number of feet in length and width, and the direction the claim lies in length from the notice, together with the section, if known, and the<pb n="1145" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="117" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>county; and shall place stone monuments at the four comers, and otherwise de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />scribe corners so that they can be readily found.

<p>Sec. 6.

Upon receiving said appli<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cation and fee the surveyor shall record the application together with the affi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />davit, and he shall thereupon forthwith proceed to survey said claim and for<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ward the field notes to the commissioner of the general land office within thirty days after filing the application, in default of which he shall pay the aggrieved party such damages as he may sustain, and in addition thereto shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction fined not less than twenty dollars nor more than one hundred dollars; and it shall be the duty of the applicants to see that the field notes are so returned. The fee of twenty dollars shall cover all the services provided for in this section.

And shall in addition to this amount of work, annually pay to the treasurer of the state the sum of fifty ($50) dollars on each and every claim filed upon, which amount shall be credited to the fund to which the land belongs upon which the claim is located: Provided, That all amounts so paid shall be a credit upon the final payment for such land provided for in section nine of this act.

Upon the failure of any one of several co-owners to contribute his proportion of the expenditures required in this act within the necessary time, the co-owners who have per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />formed the labor or made the improvements, or paid the fees or other expendi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tures required in this act, may, at the expiration of the year in which the same is to be done, give notice in writing- or notice by publication in a newspaper published in the county where the mining is, if any; if none in such county, then in the newspaper published nearest to the mine, for at least once a week for ninety days. If after such personal notice in writing or by publica<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion, such delinquent should fail or refuse to contribute his proportion of the expenditure required by this act, his interest in the claim shall become the<pb n="1146" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="118" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>property of his co-workers Mho have made the required expenditures. An affidavit by the co-owners forfeiting the interest of such delinquent shall, when recorded in the office of the proper surveyor, be sufficient evidence of such delinquency.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. That when a tunnel is run for the development of a vein or lode, or for the discovery of mines, the owner of such tunnel shall have the right of pos<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />session of all veins or lodes within two thousand feet from the face of such claim, on the line thereof, not previously known to exist, discovered in such tunnel to the same extent as if discovered from the surface; and locations on the line of such tunnel of veins or lodes not appearing on the surface, made by other parties after the commencement of the tunnel and while the same is being prosecuted with reasonable diligence, shall be invalid, but failure to prosecute the work in the tunnel for six months shall be considered as an abandonment of the right of all undiscovered veins on the line of said tunnel.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. Whenever the owners of any mining claim shall desire a patent, they shall, within five years after the filing of the application for survey, file their application for a patent upon their claim with the commissioner of the general land office, accompanied with the receipt of the state treasurer, showing that twenty-five dollars per acre has been paid by the applicant for patent to the state treasurer. No patent shall be issued in any case until the expiration of sixty days from the filing of the application. Upon filing said application, the applicant shall cause to be published for four successive weeks, one insertion each week, in some newspaper published in the county in which the mine is situated, if there be any; if not, then in some newspaper published in the nearest county to the mine in which a newspaper is published, a notice stating the fact that ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />plication has been filed for patent on the claim (or claims), describing them clearly. A copy of the printed notice with affidavit that it has been published as required by this section, and that all the requirements of this act have been complied with, shall be filed with the commissioner of the general land office be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fore patent shall issue. After the expiration of thirty days after the last inser<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion of said notice, patent shall issue unless protest has been filed.</p>
<p>Sec. 10. Any person or association of persons qualified as required by section 1 of this act, shall have the right to locate and obtain a patent on any quantity of these lands containing deposits of coal, iron ore, kaolin, baryta, salt, marble, fire clay, oil, natural gas, or valuable building stones, in legal subdivisions of the section, not exceeding one hundred and sixty acres to an individual person or three hundred and twenty acres to an association or corporation, upon compliance with the general land law in regard to obtaining titles and with regulations of section 9 in regard to publication, etc., and the payment to the state treasurer of not less than ten dollars per acre for such lands where the same shall be situated more than ten miles from any completed railroad, and not less than twenty dollars for such lands as shall be within ten miles of such road: Provided, That when any as<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sociation of not less than four persons shall have expended not less than five thousand dollars in working and improving any such mine or mines, such asso<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ciation may enter not exceeding six hundred and forty acres, including such min<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing improvements: And provided further, That this act shall be held to author<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ize only one entry by the same person or association of persons under its pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />visions; and no association of persons, any member of which shall have taken the benefit of this act, either as an individual or as a member of any other association, shall enter or hold any other land under the provisions of this act; and no member of any association which shall have taken the benefit of<pb n="1147" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="119" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>this act shall enter or hold any other lands under its provisions: And provided further, That nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the sale of lands valuable for mines of gold, silver, and copper, or other minerals enumerated in section 4.</p>
<p>Sec. 11. Any person desiring to contest the issuance of patent may do so by filing with the commissioner of the general land office a protest, setting forth the grounds of objection generally, and that protestant has an interest in the subject matter, which protest shall also state that the same is presented in good faith and not to injure or delay the applicants, or any of them, and the same shall be verified by affidavit; whereupon it shall be the duty of the commissioner to withhold patent until the controversy is ended: Provided, That if the pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />testant shall not, within thirty days after filing his protest, institute suit in the court having jurisdiction thereof in the county where the claims are located, his protest shall constitute no further barrier to the issuance of patent. A certified copy of tire petition or a certificate of the clerk of the court where suit is pend<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing shall be sufficient evidence to the commissioner of the pendency of the suit and of the date of filing said suit. When the land in controversy lies partly in two counties, suit may be brought in either. More than one claim shall not be embraced in the same patent or application. The suits here provided for shall be entitled to precedence of trial on the docket.</p>
<p>Sec. 12. When a location has been made in land disposed of by the state since the passage of an act for disposition of minerals on the land embraced in the first section of this act, approved April 14, 1883, if such location was made sub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sequent to the disposition by the state of such lands, and the locator or his as<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />signees have not abandoned said claim, but is working it in good faith, locator and his assignees shall nevertheless be entitled to the mineral and to the use of the superficial area as in other cases; and if the case is such that the fee in the land cannot pass by patent, a patent may issue to all the minerals in the claims, and shall be a license from the state to enter upon and work said claim and extract the mineral therefrom. In cases provided for in this section when the fee does not pass, the price shall be twenty dollars per acre, and the locator or his assignee shall in addition pay to the owner of the land in fee the fair value of the land so taken up by his claim, and roads and fences necessary to give him ingress and egress thereto, and be liable for any damages which may result to owner of the land in fee. All other provisions of this act shall apply to said location.</p>
<p>Sec. 13. All claims upon which patent has not been applied for within five years next after the application for survey, or which have not been surveyed and the field notes returned to the general land office within the time prescribed there<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />for as hereinbefore provided, or upon which the assessment work has not been done, an affidavit therefor, filed as provided by this act, shall be and are declared forfeited without judicial action of any kind and subject to location as origi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nally, but not by any one interested in the claim at the time of forfeiture; and any location for or on behalf of any such party shall be wholly void. Whenever any such claim shall be relocated, the locators and each of them shall make affi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />davit that the location is made without any contract or agreement of any kind that any of the parties owning an interest in the location before relocation has or is to have any interest in the same. In all other cases where affidavit is re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quired by this act it may be made by one or more of the parties cognizant of the facts.</p>
<p>Sec. 14. No claim which has been forfeited for any cause shall be sub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ject to relocation for a period of thirty days next thereafter; and the party owning the same may apply to the land commissioner within that time for<pb n="1148" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="120" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>relief, and if it appear to him from the proof submitted that the forfeiture was not occasioned by the negligence of the owner, but by circumstances which he could not reasonably control, the commissioner may, within that time, in his discretion, grant relief against the forfeiture, and if he grants such relief he shall at once forward his order to that effect to the surveyor, who shall file the same for record in his office.</p>
<p>Sec. 15. Whenever any application shall be made to buy or obtain title to any of the lands embraced in section one of this act, except where the applica<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion is made under this act, the applicant shall make oath that there is not, to the best of his knowledge and belief, any of the mineral embraced in this act thereon, and when the commissioner has any doubt in relation to the matter he shall forbear action until he is satisfied. And any sale or disposition of said lands shall be understood to be with a reservation of the mineral thereon to be sub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ject to location as herein provided.</p>
<p>Sec. 16. That claims usually called placers, including all forms of metallic de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />posits, excepting veins of quartz or rock in place, shall be subject to entry and patent under like circumstances and conditions, and upon similar proceedings as are provided for vein or lode claims. All placer claims located shall conform as near as practicable with existing surveys and their subdivisions, and no such lo<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cation shall include more than forty acres for each individual claimant, and shall not exceed three hundred and twenty acres for any association of persons. The price which shall be paid for such placer shall not be less than ten dollars per acre, together with all costs of proceedings as before provided.</p>
<p>Sec. 17. When non-mineral land, not contiguous to the vein or lode, is used by the prospector of such vein or lode for mining or milling purposes, such non<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />adjacent surface ground may be embraced and included in an application for a patent for such vein or lode, and the same may be patented therewith subject to the same preliminary requirements as to survey and notice as are applicable to veins or lodes; but no location of such non-adjacent lands shall exceed ten acres, and payment for the same must be made at the same rate as fixed by this act for the superficies of the lode. The owner of a quartz mill or reduction works, not owning a mine in connection therewith, may also receive a patent for a mill site as provided in this section.</p>
<p>Sec. 18. Any owner or worker of mining claim under this act is authorized to fell and remove for building and mining purposes any timber or any trees growing or being upon unoccupied lands as described in section one, said lands being mineral and subject to entry only as mineral lands, under such miles and regulations as may be prescribed for the protection of timber and undergrowth upon such lands and for other purposes.</p>
<p>Sec. 19. The great importance of the mining interest of the state, and the uncertainty existing by reason of the abolishment of the land board, causes con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fusion in our mining laws, and creates an emergency, and an imperative necessity exists requiring the suspension of the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days be suspended, and said rule is so suspended, and this act shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted. All laws in conflict with this act are hereby repealed.</p>

</opener>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That no refined petroleum, kerosene, or any other illuminating fluids, in whole or in part petroleum, or any product of petroleum, be they designated by whatever name, the fire test of which is 110 degrees Fahrenheit, shall be sold or offered for sale for illuminating purposes before being first inspected and branded as here<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />inafter provided: Provided, however, That any of said fluids which have been inspected and branded according to the provisions of this act shall not again be subject to inspection.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. Said, fire test shall be determined by an inspector or deputy inspector, appointed under the provisions of this act, who shall use the Foster cup or Foster&#8217;s automatic oil tester, or such other well defined instrument as may be customarily used for such purpose, according to the following formula: Heat with alcohol, small flame; when the thermometer indicates ninety degrees, remove the lamp; at niney-five degrees try for a flash with small bead of fire on end of string or small hard wooden taper held within a quarter of an inch of surface of oil; replace lamp and heat oil gradually from this point until the burning point is reached, removing lamp every four degrees and allowing oil to run up three degrees before replacing lamp, flashing oil each time just before the lamp is replaced until the result is attained. Or said fire test may be made by an inspector or deputy inspector, appointed under the provisions of this act, who shall use the Foster cup or Foster&#8217;s automatic oil tester according to the direc<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions accompanying same and prescribed by the manufacturers for the use of said tester.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. The governor shall appoint a suitable person, a resident of this state, who is not interested in manufacturing, dealing in, or vending any of said illuminating fluids, as state inspector of oils, and who shall not be inter<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ested in the Foster cup or other apparatus, whose term of office shall be for two years from the date of appointment or until his successor shall be ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pointed and shall qualify. The state inspector, when appointed, shall by and with the consent of the governor divide the state into convenient inspection districts, which districts may from time to time in the same manner be changed for the purpose of facilitating inspections under this act. And the said inspector is hereby empowered to appoint a suitable number of deputy district inspectors, who shall be empowered to perform the same duties in the districts for which they are appointed and be liable to the same penalties as the state inspector. And said inspector may, for reasonable cause, remove any of said deputies. It shall be the duty of the said inspector and his depu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ties to provide themselves, at their own expense, with the necessary instru<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments and apparatus for inspecting said fluids, and to promptly inspect the same when called upon for that purpose.

<p>Sec. 4. It shall be the duty of the state inspector and district deputy inspectors, within their respective districts, to inspect without delay all said fluids offered for sale by any manufacturer, vendor, or dealer, as hereinbefore provided in section 2, and if upon such inspection the said fluids shall meet the requirements of said section, the inspector making the same shall fix his brand or device, viz., &#8220;Approved,&#8221; with the date, over his official signature, upon the package, barrel, or cask containing the same; but if the said fluids so inspected shall not meet said requirements, he shall fix his brand or device, viz., &#8220;Rejected for illuminating purposes,&#8221; with the date, over his official signature, upon the package, barrel, or cask containing the same. And where the fluids is contained in cans, two or more of which are encased in wood, he shall also fix his brand upon the case containing such packages.

<p>Sec. 8. Every person appointed a state inspector or deputy inspector shall, before he enters upon the discharge of the duties of his office, take the oath of office and file the same in the office of the secretary of state. The state inspector shall execute a bond to the state in the sum of ten thousand dollars, and each deputy district inspector shall execute a like bond in the sum of five thousand dollars, both with good and sufficient sureties, to be approved by the secretary of state, conditioned for the faithful performance of the duties imposed upon them by the provisions of this act, which bond shall be for the use of all persons in any way aggrieved or injured by the act or neglect of the inspector executing the same, and the said bonds shall be filed with the secretary of state.

</opener>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That it shall be unlawful for any person, unless a qualified pharmacist within the meaning of this act, to open or conduct any pharmacy or store for compounding medicines, or for any one not a qualified pharmacist to prepare physicians&#8217; prescriptions or compound medicines, except under the direct supervision of a qualified pharmacist as hereinafter provided.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. Any person in order to be qualified, shall be twenty-one years old and shall have passed a satisfactory examination before the board of pharmacy of Texas, or shall be a graduate in pharmacy or an assistant in pharmacy.</p>

<p>Sec. 8. Any person in order to become a qualified pharmacist within the mean<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing of this act, shall apply and appear for examination and registration, and shall pay to the board of pharmacy five dollars; and on passing the examination required, shall be furnished free of cost a certificate of registration signed by the said board. Should said person fail to pass a satisfactory examination, he may at any other one meeting of the board of pharmacy within twelve months be permitted to be examined without cost.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. Graduates, as specified in section three, shall apply for registration and if they produce satisfactory evidence to the board of pharmacy that they have a right to be registered, shall, upon paying the said board three dollars, be furnished a certificate of registration without examination.</p>

<p>Sec. 12. Any person not a qualified pharmacist, but continues to compound pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />scriptions or retail medicines without complying with this act, shall upon the first conviction be sentenced to pay a fine of not less than fifty nor more than one hundred dollars; and upon the second and every subsequent conviction, shall be sentenced to a fine of not less than one hundred nor more than two hundred dollars.</p>
<p>Sec. 13. Any person who shall procure or attempt to procure registration for himself or for another, under this act, by making or causing to be made any false representation, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be fined not less than twenty-five nor more than one hundred dollars, and the name of the person so fraudulently registered shall be stricken from the register.</p>

<p>Sec. 15. All courts having jurisdiction in criminal causes are required to give this act in charge to each grand jury impanelled in such courts.</p>
<p>Sec. 16. This act shall not apply to towns and cities containing less than one thousand inhabitants. Towns and cities that arrive at one or more thousand inhabitants on and after the passage of this act shall come within its provisions. The manner of ascertaining the census shall be the last official one, whether it be federal, state, town, or city.</p>
<p>Sec. 17. Nothing in this act shall be construed to apply to any practitioner of medicine who does not keep open shop for compounding, dispensing, and selling medicines, nor so construed as to prevent any person or persons from investing their means in a drug store or stores: Provided, They keep employed qualified pharmacists for the direct supervision of vending and compounding medicines.</p>
<p>Sec. 18. The near approach of the close of the present session of the legislature, and the great improbability of reaching this bill in its regular call, and the great importance for legislation on the subject embraced in this bill, creates an emergency and a public necessity requiring the suspension of the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days be suspended, and it is so suspended, and that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

And such board of trustees shall constitute a body corporate and shall have full power to protect the title, possession, and use of all such property within the limits of such city or town, and may bring and maintain such suit or suits in law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction, when necessary, to recover the title or possession of any such property that may be adversely held or seized, or to prevent any trespass upon or injury to such property, and the power and authority of any such board of trustees to bring and maintain any suit in relation to the recovery of such property or of the possession and use thereof, or for any trespass thereon or injury thereto that may now be pending in any court of this state, is hereby authorized, ratified, and confirmed: Provided, That the provisions of this section (1) shall not apply to lands belonging to the state upon which houses for school purposes have been built without authority from the state.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. That the treasurer of the board of trustees of any such city or town, before entering upon the duties of his office, shall execute a bond with two or more good and sufficient sureties, payable to the state of Texas, and to be approved by such board of trustees, and in such sum as shall be fixed by said board of trustee, not less than one-half of the annual school revenues that shall come into his hands, conditioned that such treasurer will receive and disburse such school funds as shall come into his hands according to law, and that he will render a full and true account of all such funds.</p>

<p>Sec. 4. In such cities and towns as have assumed the exclusive control of the public free schools within their limits, and have decided under the laws providing therefor that a special tax shall be levied for the support of such public free schools, the mayor and council or board of aldermen of such city or town shall annually assess and levy such tax by ordinance duly passed and approved in the same manner as is required in the assessment and levy of taxes for general purposes in such city or town. In cities and towns which have voted upon and directed the levy of a special tax not exceeding one-half of one per cent., the mayor and council or board of aldermen of such city or town shall annually levy such rate of taxes for public school purposes, not exceeding one-half of one per cent, as shall be sufficient for the support of the public free schools for the term as required by law, but in such cities and towns as have voted upon and decided at an election held for that purpose that a specific rate of taxes shall be assessed and levied in such city or town for the support of its public free schools, the mayor and council or board of aldermen of such city or town shall have no discretion in fixing the rate at which such tax shall be levied, but shall assess and levy the same at the rate fixed in the proposition as submitted and adopted by the qualified voters of such city or town at the election held for that purpose.</p>

<p>Sec. 4. Said road commissioner shall report to the commissioners court at each regular term under oath, showing an itemized account of all money he has received to be expended on roads or bridges and what disposition he has made of the money, and showing the condition of all roads, bridges, and culverts in his district, and such other facts as the court may desire information upon, and shall make such other reports and at such time as the court may desire.</p>

<p>Section 1.

<p>Sec. 2. The apportionment of such indebtedness shall be made upon the taxable values of the whole territory liable for such indebtedness as shown by the first assessment rolls made after the severance of such territory, and<pb n="1165" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="137" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>the territory severed shall pay that proportion of the entire indebtedness which its taxable values bear to the taxable values of the whole territory liable.</p>

<p>Sec. 4. When the territory taken is added to and made a part of an organized county, it shall be the duty of the commissioners court of such county to levy and have collected on all property in such territory a tax sufficient to pay their pro rata of the indebtedness, said tax not to exceed the constitutional limit; and it shall be the duty of the commissioners court of the county to which any unorganized county may be attached for judicial purposes to levy and have col<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lected on all property in such unorganized county owned or held by resident citi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />zens a tax for the purpose of paying such indebtedness.</p>
<p>Sec. 5.

<p>Sec. 5a. All county taxes due unorganized counties collected by the comptroller shall be kept by him to the credit of such unorganized county until the same shall have been organized, then he shall, upon demand of the treasurer of the former unorganized county, pay the same over to the said treasurer: Provided That in case any unorganized county is indebted to any county from which the same has been created, and which debt existed at the time of its creation, the comptroller shall use so much of said fund as may be necessary to pay the pro rata share of such debt due by such unorganized county, and an order of the commissioners court of the parent county stating the amount due from the unorganized county shall be authority for the comptroller to draw his warrant for said amount, and the provisions of this section shall apply to all money now held by the comptroller for unorganized counties and to all money hereafter collected.</p>

<p>Whereas it is alleged that the copyright of the state to the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals Reports, published under chapter 12 of the Acts of 1882, approved May 3, 1882, has been violated by the unauthorized publication of said reports: Therefore.</p>

<p>Whereas the immense deposit of granite and marble in several counties of this state assures to Texas a high rank in point of building resources, and also prom<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ises extensive industrial enterprises to her people; and whereas Burnet County has furnished the entire granite stone for the new state capitol when the most diligent research failed to find available material suited for this purpose elsewhere in this commonwealth, the said Burnet County granite having been decided by the best architects and experts in America, to be capable of the highest polish and greatest durability of any in the United States and equal to any in the known world; and whereas the granite for the capitol building (one of the first in the United States) was a present to the state of Texas free of charge by W.

<p>Sec. 2. That as said W. H. Westfall, G. W. Lacy, and N. L.
