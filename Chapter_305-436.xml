Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That an act to amend an act entitled An Act to create a commission of arbitration and award and to define the powers and duties thereof and to make appropriation to pay the salaries of the judges thereof approved Feby 9th 1881, shall hereafter read as follows.</p>
<p>Section 1. A Commission of arbitration and award, to consist of three persons learned in the law to be appointed by the Governor by and with the advice and consent of the Senate if in session, or without such advice and consent, if not in session, who shall hold their offices for two years from Oct. 1st 1883, and receive for their services the same salaries as judges of the Supreme Court of the State of Texas, be and the same is hereby created to be styled the Commission of Appeals of the State of Texas. In case of a vacancy on said commission by death or resignation of any member thereof during the vacation of the Legislature, it shall be the<pb n="332" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="26" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>duty of the Governor to fill the same by appointment and the person so appointed shall continue in office until the next session of the Legisla<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ture after the appointment.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. That in addition to the powers and duties now conferred by said act the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals of this State are hereby authorized and empowered to refer to the Commissioners of Appeals of the State of Texas, any civil case or cases now or hereafter pending be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fore said Courts for examination and report thereon: And it shall be the duty of said Supreme Court and Court of Appeals in order to relieve the dockets of said Courts of the great number of cases now encumbering them from time to time do refer to said Commissioners of Appeals, so many of said cases now or hereafter pending in said courts as may be rea<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sonably considered and acted upon bjr the same, at the several sessions thereof, having respect in such reference to the length of time such cases may have been pending as well as to promote an early disposition of the cases on the docket.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. When said commissioners of appeals have considered and de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />termined upon the proper disposition of any case referred to the same according to section 2 of this act, their opinion shall be submitted to<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gether with a brief synopsis of the case, to the court from which the case was referred, and the record shall be returned therewith. The re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ports so made may be used by the respective courts to facilitate them in reaching a conclusion upon the law and the facts in the case.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. The opinions of said commissioners of appeals in cases referred to them by the supreme court, when adopted by said court, shall be pub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lished as the opinions thereof as in other cases.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. That in cases referred to the commissioners of appeals under this act the papers thereof shall not be refiled in said commission and only such additional costs as may be essential to carry into effect the provisions hereof shall be incurred by the parties to such cases by reason of the reference thereof.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. That section one of this act which provides for a continuance of the Commission of Appeals for two years from October 1st 1883 shall not take effect until October 1st 1883 and it shall become inoperative at said time in case an amendment to the judiciary article of the Constitu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion of the State shall before then be submitted by the Legislature to the electors of the State and adopted by the people providing for an increase of the judges of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Sec. 7. The accumulation of business on the dockets of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals is so great as to improperly retard the admin<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />istration of justice, and this with the fact that the great number of bills awaiting consideration by the Legislature, may jeopardize, for want of time, the passage of this act, creates an imperative public emergency for the immediate passage of this act and that the rule requiring bills to be read on three several days be suspended as a public necessity requires&#8217; this act to take effect and be in force from and after its passage and it is so enacted.</p>

<p>Sec. 2. The fact that in many counties of the State the compensation of the county treasurers is so grossly inadequate as to induce the fear that the office will be vacant, creates an emergency and an imperative public necessity that the constitutional rule requiring hills to W read on three several days be suspended, and that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is accordingly so enacted.</p>

</opener>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That article 1134 of the Revised Statutes of the State of Texas, be so amended as to read as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1134. The county judge shall, before entering on the duties of his office, execute a bond with two or more good and sufficient sure<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ties, to be approved by the commissioners&#8217; court of his county in a sum of not less than one thousand dollars nor more than five thousand dollars, the amount of said bond to be determined and fixed by the county com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioners&#8217; court, payable to the treasurer of his county conditioned that he will pay over to the person or officer entitled to receive it, all moneys that may come into his hands as county judge, within thirty days after he shall have received the same, and take the oath of office prescribed in the Constitution, and the further oath required of the several members of the commissioners&#8217; court.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. That an additional article shall be inserted in the Revised Civil Statutes, to read as follows, viz;</p>
<p>Article 1134a. That the county judges now in office in this State, shall within thirty clays after this act takes effect, execute bonds in ac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cordance with the provisions of the first section of this act, and upon the failure of the county judge of any county to execute such bond within thirty days or before the next regular term of the commissioners&#8217; court of such county, after the expiration of said thirty days, it shall be the duty of such court to declare the office of county judge vacant, and pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceed at once to fill such vacancy in the manner prescribed by law.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. Whereas, under the laws now in force a large amount of the county funds are collected by the county judge from those hiring county convicts; and whereas, a large amount of the school fund belonging to the counties pass through his hands; and whereas; there is no adequate protection for such funds under the laws now in force in this State; therefore an imperative public necessity and emergency exists for the immediate passage of this act: It is therefore enacted that the constitu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days be suspended, and that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage.</p>

Any station agent failing or refusing to post up said notices within two days after the same shall have been fur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nished him, or failing to keep the same posted, as herein required, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction of the same be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fore any court having the proper jurisdiction, shall be fined not less than twenty-five dollars and not more than one hundred dollars.

<p>Sec. 10. That direct and prompt remedies may be had, and penalties enforeed in case of violation of any laws herein named, it is made the special duty of the Attorney General, whenever information is filed with him by the State Engineer, or any other person, that any railroad com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pany in this State has violated any provisions of the laws of this State, providing for the transportation of passengers or freight, or is unjustly discriminating in its charges for transportation against any person or place in this State, or is guilty of extortion in its charges for transporta<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion against any persons or place in this State, or is guilty of extortion in its charges for transportation of passengers and freight, or for im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />proper condition of road Red, track, bridges, or other structures, cars, station-houses or platforms, to give ten days notice in writing to said corporation of said complaint, and after an investigation of the matter he shall proceed to determine whether the matters complained of are vio<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lations of the law, and shall give notice to said company of his decision respecting the same, and if any such violation of the law is continued, after the railroad company is so notified, or if the actual damage is not paid to the party aggrieved, within ten days after such notification, he shall cause proceedings to be instituted against said railroad company or companies, to recover the penalties provided by law; provided, that noth<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing herein contained shall be construed to prevent any citizen of this State from bringing suit in his own name against any railroad or trans<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />portation company for discrimination in freight or passenger charges; provided further, that the penalties prescribed by law for any overcharge shall not be recoverable unless the party aggrieved shall give notice thereof in writing, to the railroad company, or to the agent demanding or receiving the same, and said company shall fail within twenty days thereafter, to refund to such party aggrieved, the amount of such over<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />charge.</p>

<p>Sec. 4.

<p>Sec. 5. Whenever any person shall estray any animal on which any county brand may be found, it shall be the duty of the county clerk of the county in which said estray may be, to immediately send a notice, containing a full description of said animal, together with the marks and brands, to the county clerk of the county to which the county brand may belong, and it shall be the duty of the county clerk of said county brand to record said notice in a, book kept for that purpose, and post the same on the court house door; and it shall further be his duty to ascertain from his record of brands, to whom said animal may belong, and to notify said owner by letter otherwise, and for such services he shall be entitled to a fee of one dollar from said owner, and the county clerk furnishing the notice shall be entitled to a fee of one dollar from said owner.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. Any county clerk who shall fail to send a notice as required in section 5, of this act, the county clerk so failing shall become liable to the original owner of said estray in an amount, equal to the value of said estray.</p>
<p>Sec. 7. It shall be the duty of the Secretary of State to furnish a printed list of the county brands, to the county clerks of this State, who shall securely post the same in their office.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. Whereas the near approach to the end of the session of the Legislature, and we now have no laws by which notice can be given to the owners of estray stock in the county of their residence, therefore an emergency exists that requires the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days be suspended.</p>

Land which has on it timber suitable for lumber and shingles shall not be sold except to actual settlers and at a price not less than five dollars per acre under such regulations as the board may prescribe in tracts of not less than one hundred and sixty acres nor more than six hundred and forty acres, the Land Board shall in every sale of<pb n="395" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="89" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>timber or timbered land where the timber is suitable for lumber or shin<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gles, make such provision in the sale as will protect the timber from trespass on adjacent land embraced by this act not sold; provided, that if any purchaser of said timbered land, before final and full payment, shall cut, sell or destroy or permit any one else to cut or destroy any more timber than is necessary in clearing and improving said lands, and for firewood and building purposes, he shall forfeit all claim to said land, and in case of any violation of this provision of this act it shall be the duty of the proper district or county attorney to institute suit in the dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />trict court of the county in which the land is situated in the name of the State, against any such purchaser, to have such forfeiture duly adjudged and executed and a judgment entered for the State for such damages as may be established on the trial of said cause.</p>
<p>Sec. 16. Pasture lands or agricultural lands not timbered, may be leased in suitable quantities for stock and ranche purposes for not less than four cents per acre per annum and for periods not exceeding ten years, by such agents and under such regulations as the board may pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />scribe. The regulations shall provide for competition. Leases shall be made in the localities where the land is situated. Where there is an ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />plication for both sale and lease the sale shall have the preference.</p>
<p>Sec. 17. All lands leased shall remain subject to purchase for actual settlement in bodies not to exceed six hundred and forty acres; but be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fore said purchaser shall be permitted to buy leased land he shall swear that he intends to actually settle on it and until he does actually settle, build and fence thereon the lessee shall remain in possession; provided, that when the lessee has but one watered section leased from the State in the same vicinity, such section shall not be subject to sale and settlement during the term of the lease; and provided further, that when a sale is made of leased land then the lessee shall be entitled to have a pro rata of any rent which he shall have paid in advance, refunded him by the Treas<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />urer of the State upon warrant drawn by the Comptroller by order of the Land Board; provided, that no enclosure bordering on, along or across any stream of water shall be of a width of more than four miles and a space of at least forty yards shall be left open between all such enclosures.</p>
<p>Sec. 18.

<p>Sec. 19. All laws and parts of laws in conflict herewith are hereby repealed.</p>
<p>Sec. 20. The fact that there is no law authorizing the sale and lease of the land herein for a sufficient price under fair competition, and the fact this measure may fail, if it is delayed to come up in regular order, creates an imperative public necessity and emergency that the rule re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quiring this bill to be read on three several days be suspended; and that this act shall take effect from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas That Title 17 Chapter 10 be amended by adding thereto the following articles to be known as articles 503a and 503b.</p>
<p>Article 503a. Whenever fifty qualified voters of any territory within the limits of any incorporated town shall sign and present a petition to the mayor of such city praying that such territory, setting the same out by metes and bounds be declared no longer a part of such town, it shall be the duty of the mayor thereof to order an election within thirty days thereafter to be holden at the different voting precincts of said town: and if a majority of the legal voters of said town voting at such election, cast their votes in favor of discontinuing said territory as a part of said town the mayor of said city shall declare such territory no longer a part of said city and shall enter an order to that effect on the minutes or rec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ords of the city council, and from and after the date of such order said territory shall cease to be a part of said town: provided no city or town shall thus be reduced to a less area than one square mile or one mile in diameter around the centre of the original corporate limits.</p>

<p>Sec. 3. When a prospector or miner shall discover upon any of said lands any mine of coal, iron, tin, copper, lead, silver or gold he shall im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mediately stake the same in its apparent extent not to exceed in size three hundred feet one way by fifteen hundred feet the other way, the corners to be marked by distinct stone land marks and shall within forty days thereafter file a description of said mine, the county in which it is sit<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />uated, the number of survey, the company or individual to whom the same was issued, and such other description as is practicable in the clerk&#8217;s office of the county where the land lies or if in an unorganized county, then in the county to which the same is attached for surveying purposes, which description shall be verified by an affidavit of the fact that he is the discoverer of said mine, and that he intends to fully prospect the same and comply with the law pertaining to the same in good faith; and shall be registered in the record of deeds.

<p>Sec. 4.

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That Article 4684, of Title 95, Chapter 2, of the Revised Civil Statutes shall be so amended as to hereafter read as follows,: to-wit:</p>
<p>Article 4684. Every bank, whether of issue or deposit, banker, broker, dealer in exchange, or stock jobber, shall, at the time fixed by this chapter for listing personal property, make out and furnish the assessor of taxes a sworn statement showing,</p>
<p>1st; If a national bank, the president, or some other officer of such bank, shall furnish to the assessor of the county, in which such bank is located, a list of the names of all the share holders of the stock, together with the number and amount of the shares of each shareholder of stock, in said bank; and the shareholders of the stocks in national banks shall render to the tax assessor of the county in which such bank is located the number of their shares, and the true and full value thereof. All shares of stocks in National banks not rendered to the assessor of taxes in the county where such bank is located within the time prescribed by law for listing property for taxes, shall be assessed by the assessor against the owner or owners thereof as unrendered property is assessed; but the tax roll shall show the name of the owner or owners thereof as per statement furnished by the president or other officer of said bank.</p>
<p>2nd; National banks shall render all other bonds and stocks of every kind (except United States bonds), and all shares of capital stocks, or joint stock or stocks of other companies or corporations held as an invest<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment, or in any way representing assets, together with all other personal property belonging or pertaining to said bank, except such personal<pb n="418" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="112" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>property as is specially exempted from taxation by the laws of the United States.</p>
<p>3rd; National banks shall be required to render all of their real estate, as other real estate is rendered, and all the personal property of said Na<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tional banks herein taxed shall be valued as other personal property is valued.</p>
<p>4th; All other banks, bankers, brokers or dealers in exchange, or stock jobbers, shall render their list in the manner following: 1st, the amount, of money on hand, or in transit, or in the hands of other banks, bankers, brokers, or others subject to draft, whether the same be in or out of the State (except United States Treasury notes;) 2nd, the amount of bills receivable, discounted or purchased, and other credits due or to become due, including accounts receivable, interest accrued but not due, and in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />terest due and unpaid; 3rd, from the aggregate amount of the items named in the 1st and 2nd of the last two subdivisions shall be deducted the amount of money on deposit; 4th, the amount of bonds and stocks of every kind (except United States bonds,) and all shares of capital stocks or joint stocks of other companies or corporations held as an in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vestment, or in any way representing assets; 5th, all other property be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />longing or appertaining to said bank or business, including both personal property and real estate, shall be listed as other personal property and real estate.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. Whereas, the assessors are now assessing taxes for 1883, and, whereas, the present law defining how National and other banks shall be taxed is very defective, therefore an imperative public necessity exists, requiring the suspension of the constitutional rule, which requires bills to be read on three several days in each house, and the same is hereby sus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pended, and that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage; and it is so enacted.</p>
