<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That neither intoxication, nor temporary insanity of mind, produced by the voluntary recent use of ardent spirits, shall constitute any excuse in this State for the commission of crime, nor shall intoxication mitigate either the degree or the penalty of crime, but evidence of temporary insanity produced by such use of ardent spirits may be introduced by the defendant in any criminal prosecution in mitigation of the penalty at<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tached to the offense for which he is being tried, and in cases of murder for the purpose of determining the degree of murder of which the de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fendant may be found guilty.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. It shall be the duty of the several district and county judges of this State, in any criminal prosecution pending before them, where temporary insanity is relied upon as a defense and the evidence tends to show that such insanity was brought about by the immoderate use of intoxicating liquors, to charge the jury in accordance with the provisions of section 1 of this act.</p>

<p>Sec. 74. Whenever a penitentiary is leased an inventory and valua<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion of all the materials, machinery and property of every description belonging to the penitentiary, except such reservations as the penitentiary board may direct, and except the land, shall be made by appraisers, one of whom shall be appointed by the governor and the other by the lessees, and in case of disagreement between the appraisers, they shall select an umpire.

<p>Sec. 80. The penitentiary board may prescribe what class or classes of convicts may be hired out or put to labor outside the prison walls, and such other regulations pertaining to the same as may be deemed proper, but no convict shall be put to outside labor when his labor can be utilized within the walls; provided, that on the first day of January, 1882, or as soon thereafter as practicable, the penitentiary board shall provide that as many convicts as can be comfortably accommodated and profitably employed be confined within the walls of the penitentiaries now or here<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />after established.</p>

<p>Sec. 83. That this act is intended to take the place of all other laws in regard to the organization of the penitentiaries, and that all acts and parts of acts in conflict herewith are hereby repealed.</p>
<p>Sec. 84. The fact of the near approach of the end of the session ren<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dering it impossible to do so constitutes an emergency and, an imperative public necessity, which justifies the suspension of the constitutional rule requiring this bill to be read on three several days, therefore the said rule is hereby suspended; and whereas it is necessary that work should be commenced at once, under the provisions of this bill, therefore an emer<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gency exists which requires that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted, by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That article 4752, of title 95, chapter 4, of the Revised Statutes, shall be amended so as hereafter to read as follows, viz:</p>
<p>&#8220;Article 4752. In making sales of real property for taxes the collector shall advertise the same for sale in some newspaper published in the county where the land is to be sold, for three successive weeks, if there be one, and the publisher of such newspaper shall receive as compensation not exceeding twenty-five cents for each tract or parcel of land so adver<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tised, to be taxed as other costs of sale against such land; provided, the cost of advertising in a newspaper shall be deducted from the fees allowed the collector for advertising; and, provided, that the comptroller shall<pb n="144" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="52" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>allow the collector twenty-five cents per tract for each tract of land bid off by the State; and if there be no newspaper published in the county, or there being a newspaper published in the county, and the publisher thereof refuses to publish the advertisements at the price herein fixed, then advertisement shall be made by posting the same for thirty days previous to the day of sale, at the court-house door and three other public places in the county where the land or lots are situated, giving in said advertisement such description as is given to the same on the tax rolls in his hands, stating the name of the owner, if known, and if unknown, say &#8220;unknown,&#8221; together with time, place and terms of sale, said sale to be for cash, to the highest bidder, at public outcry, at the court-house door, and between legal hours, on the first Tuesday of the month.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sec. 2. Whereas, the law only requires tax sales to be posted, which is very prejudicial to land owners, the same not being sufficient notices; and, whereas, the time for advertising such sales is nearly at hand; there<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fore an imperative public necessity exists requiring the suspension of the constitutional rule requiring this bill to be read on three several days; therefore, resolved that said rule be suspended, and this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Article 1074a. In all cases where indictments have been presented against persons in one county, charging them with any offense against the Penal Code, and such causes have been removed by change of venue to another county, and tried therein, the county from which such cause is removed shall be liable for all expenses incurred for pay of jurors in trying such causes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sec. 2. That the above recited act shall be amended by adding thereto another article, to follow article 1074a, to be called article 1074b, to read as follows:</p>
<p>&#8220;Article 1074b.

<p>Sec. 9. Said board shall direct the time and manner in which all plats and field notes of surveys made by contractors under this act shall be made, one copy of which shall be deposited in the general land office.</p>
<p>Sec. 10.

All deeds, conveyances, mortgages, deeds of trust, or any other written contract relating to real estate, which are authorized to be recorded, shall be recorded in the county where such real estate, or a part thereof, is situated; provided, that all such instruments, when relating to real estate situated in an unorganized county, shall be re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />corded in the county to which such unorganized county is attached for judicial purposes; and when an unorganized county shall be organized, it shall be the duty of the commissioners&#8217; court of such newly organized county to procure from the county to which it was attached for judicial purposes, within two years from the date of organization, a transcript of all such records, which shall be taken and held as notice to all persons of<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />the existence of such instruments; provided further, that nothing in this act shall be construed to affect the registration of any such instruments heretofore made, in either a land district to which any unorganized county may have been attached, or any county to which any unorganized county may have been attached for judicial purposes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sec. 2. Whereas, there is great uncertainty as to the proper place for the recording of such instruments relating to lands in unorganized coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ties, and in order to prevent litigation, an emergency exists, and public necessity requires, that the rule requiring a bill to be read on three sev<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />eral days be suspended, and that this act go into effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

</opener>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That the judges of the district courts of this State may, by an order made and entered in open court upon the minutes of such court, upon the application in open court of any person interested as administrator, executor, heir, legatee, devisee, distributee, creditor or guardian in the administration of the estate of a deceased person, or in the guardianship of a minor, person of unsound mind, or habitual drunkard, pending in such court, transfer such administration or guardianship to the county court of the county in which such district court is there being held for further administration, upon satisfactory evidence that the county judge of said county is legally qualified to act as such in such administration.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. Be it further enacted, that all orders of transfer of estates of de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceased persons, minors, persons of unsound mind, or habitual drunkards, from the district courts to the county courts for further administration<pb n="165" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="73" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>that may have heretofore been made by such district courts under con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ditions similar to those required by the first section of this act, shall be as valid to all intents and purposes as if made under the authority of this act.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. Immediately alter the termination of the court at which the order of transfer authorized by the first section of this act, is made, it shall be the duty of the clerk thereof to transmit all the papers relating to such administration or guardianship, together with a transcript, certi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fied by him under the seal of said district court, of the record of all or<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ders, judgments and decrees of such district court in relation to such es<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tate, to the county clerk of his county, for which services he shall be allowed such fees as are now allowed him by law for similar services, to be paid as expenses of administration.</p>
<p>Sec. 4.

<p>Sec. 2. If any such lands shall have been sold for the taxes charged upon the unrendered rolls, and bought by the State, the owner thereof, his agent or attorney, shall present to the tax collector of the county in which the land is situated a sworn statement to the effect that the same land has been rendered for taxation, and placed upon the regular assess<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment rolls for the year mentioned. Said affidavit shall contain an accu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rate description of the land, and be accompanied with the certificate of the tax assessor that the same is true and correct; and the tax collector shall thereupon present such person with a written statement, officially signed, that said tax has been cancelled, and make a note of the same upon the unrendered rolls; provided, the provisions of this section shall apply to such lands at any time after the collector shall receive the rolls until the same shall have gone into the hands of a private purchaser; and if the owner shall have paid the taxes charged upon the unrendered rolls at any time previous to the passage of this act he shall be entitled to the warrant of the comptroller for the amount so paid, in the same manner as is provided in section 3 of this act, in case of redemption from individual purchasers; provided further, that the tax collector shall make no charge whatever for the duties herein mentioned.</p>

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That chapter 11, title 17, of the Revised Statutes of the State of Texas be amended by the addition of the following articles:</p>
<p>&#8220;Article 541a. Towns and villages authorized to incorporate under this chapter, or having two hundred inhabitants or over, not desiring to incorporate for municipal purposes, may incorporate for free school pur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />poses only, and when so desiring, an election may be held under the pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />visions of this title and chapter, and if at said elections a majority of the votes cast be in favor of the corporation, it shall be the duty of the county judge to make return thereof and cause a record of the result of such election to be made the same as is provided by articles 512 and 513 of this chapter; upon which entry being made such town or village shall be regarded as duly incorporated for the purpose of establishing and main<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />taining a free school therein, and shall upon notice to the state board of education by the board of trustees hereinafter provided for, receive such pro rata share of the available school fund as its scholastic population may entitle it to.</p>
<p>&#8220;Article 541b. Upon the entry of record, as provided for in the pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceding article, it shall be the duty of the county judge to forthwith order an election of five school trustees for such town or village so incorporated for school purposes, who shall be elected in the same manner and at the same time and whose term of office shall be the same as provided in this chapter for the election and term of office of mayor and aldermen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Article 541c. The trustees elected in accordance with the preceding article, shall be vested with the full management and control of the free schools of such incorporated town or village, and shall in general be vested with all the powers, rights and duties in regard to the establish<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment and maintaining of free schools, including the powers and manner of taxation, for free school purposes, that are now conferred by the laws of this State, upon the council or board of aldermen of incorporated cities and towns, as the same is prescribed by title 78, chapter 3, of the Revised Statutes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Article 541d. The board of trustees, when elected, shall organize by choosing from their number a president, a secretary, a treasurer, and an assessor and collector of taxes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Article 541e. The assessor and collector of taxes shall have the same powers and shall perform the same duties, with reference to the assess<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment and collection of taxes for free school purposes, that are conferred by this chapter and title upon the marshal of incorporated towns and villages, and he shall receive such compensation for his services as the board of trustees may allow, not to exceed four per cent of the whole amount of taxes received, and he shall give bond for the faithful dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />charge of his duties in such amount as may be prescribed by the board of trustees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Article 541f.

<p>Section 2. There being many unincorporated towns and villages in the State that desire to incorporate for free school purposes only, and it being important that such incorporations should be duly organized and ready for taking charge of their schools before the commencement of the next scholastic year, thereby creating an emergency that this act take ef<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fect from and after its passage, and it is so enacted; and the near ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />proach of the close of the session of the Legislature and the great amount of business now pending creates an imperative public necessity justifying the suspension of the constitutional rule requiring this bill to be read on three several days, and said rule is suspended.</p>

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That the caption of the above recited act shall hereafter read as follows: &#8220;An act to provide for the sale of alternate sections of lands in organ<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ized and unorganized counties as surveyed by railroad companies and other works of internal improvement and set apart for the benefit of the common school fund, to provide for the investment of the proceeds, and to repeal all laws in conflict therewith,&#8221; and that sections one, two, three, four, five, six, seven and eight of chapter twenty-eight of the laws of the special session of the Legislature of the State of Texas, approved July 8, 1879, be amended so as to read as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sec. 2. The county surveyor of the county in which said lands are located, or if the county be unorganized the district surveyor in whose district such land is located, shall view and appraise the same under oath, and make return of the same to the county commissioners&#8217; court of the county in which his office is kept, which court shall examine, approve or disapprove the same, and may take other evidence to ascertain the true value of the land, and in case of disapproval said court shall fix a value thereto, and the valuation of said land in no case shall be less than two dollars per acre for surveys having fresh water on them or bordering on them, nor less than one dollar per acre for other school lands. The sur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />veyors acting as appraisers of land shall each receive one dollar per sec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion, and in no case to exceed one hundred dollars for the appraisement of all the lands in any one county, to be paid out of the proceeds of the first sale of the land under the provisions of this act. Any persons hav<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing improvements upon any of such land prior to the taking effect of this act shall have the preference in the purchase thereof for the period of six months next after the value thereof is fixed, at the valuation exclusive of the value of such improvement; provided, that no appraisement of a surveyor of any section of land situated in an unorganized county shall be regarded until he shall have filed an affidavit stating that he knows the locality of said section, and that he personally inspected the same, stating when said inspection was made.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sec. 3. That as soon as the appraisement is completed the county<pb n="212" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="120" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>commissioners&#8217; court shall prepare tabulated reports of their action, set<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ting forth the following, to wit: Number of survey, block, quantity in each survey, the name of company or individual to whom the certificate was granted, price per acre of each section, or quarter thereof, if differ<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ence exists, value of improvements, remarks giving general description of soil, water and timber. One copy of the above report shall be filed in the office of the county or district surveyor, and shall constitute an archive of his office; one copy shall be forwarded to the commissioner of the general land office, and one copy to the treasurer of the state.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sec. 4. That upon the receipt of the above report, by the commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioner of the general land office, he shall examine the same, and if made in conformity with this act, and if in his opinion the lands therein are properly valued he shall approve the same, and shall notify the county or district surveyor of the fact, and until he receives such notice the sur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />veyor shall not entertain any proposition for the purchase of the said land; provided, that if the commissioner of the general land office believes or has reason to believe that the land is valued too low, or that the proper description has not been given of the soil, timber or water, or that the land has increased in value since appraisement, he may, and it shall be his duty to require a supplemental report containing additional information, or he may send some one from his office; or, if none of his employes can be spared or are not qualified for the service, he may appoint some suit<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />able person to visit such county concerning which the report is unsatis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />factory, who shall make a report such as is required by the county com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioners&#8217; court, for which he, the person sent, if not a regular employe, shall be paid a salary for the time employed not greater than that of the chief clerk of the land office.

<p>&#8220;Sec. 5. That so soon as the surveyor shall receive the notice provided for in section four of this act, he shall be authorized to receive applica<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions for the purchase of said land in any quantity not less than one hun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dred and sixty acres, except fractions of less than one hundred and sixty acres that may now exist in said counties; provided, that no person or corporation shall be allowed to purchase more than one section of six hundred and forty acres of said land when the same is classed as arable land suitable for farming purposes; but when the same is classed as land suitable only for grazing purposes it shall be sold in quantities to suit the purchaser, but no person shall be permitted to purchase less than one hundred and sixty acres, nor more than three sections of six hundred and forty acres within five miles of the geographical centre of any county or upon any water front, nor more than seven sections at any other place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sec. 6.

The surveyor shall be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />entitled to a fee of one dollar for each application to be paid by the ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />plicant, and he shall, upon payment of said fee, record said application in a well bound book to be kept by him for that purpose; he shall endorse such application &#8220;recorded," giving the date, page and volume of the record, and sign his name thereto, and deliver said application to the pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />posed purchaser.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sec. 7. That the purchaser shall immediately forward to the state treasurer the above application, together with one-twentieth of the ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />praised value of the land thereon designated, and if the land is chiefly valuable for timber he shall forward the whole of the appraised value. The treasurer shall enter a credit on his books in the name of the pur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />chaser for the amount so received, giving such description of the land as will identify the same; he shall then issue his receipt for said amount and forward it with the above-named application to the commissioner of the general land office, who shall file said application and receipt in his office and issue his certificate in lieu thereof, setting forth the amount paid to the treasurer and the quantity and valuation of the land applied for, which certificate shall authorize the county or district surveyor to survey the land embraced in the original application and enter the same on his books as sold, and shall not entertain another application to pur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />chase said lands until notified of the forfeiture as hereinafter specified; provided, should the applicant fail to make his first payment of one-twen<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tieth, or the whole as the case may be, of the appraised value of the land embraced in his application to the treasurer and present, the certificate of the commissioner of the general land office to the surveyor or his deputy within ninety days from the date of the record of his application, then and in that case the said land shall be again for sale and the surveyor shall be authorized to receive applications for the same; provided, that no person shall renew his file nor file on the same land more than once in twelve months, nor shall any person refile or renew his file in the name of any other person. All applications for the purchase of said lands shall be made in the real name of the person intending to be the actual pur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />chaser thereof.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sec. 8. That so soon as the application above-named has been received by the surveyor, the applicant shall execute his obligation or promissory note for the balance of the appraised value of the land he desires to pur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />chase, agreeing and stipulating to pay to the governor of the State of Texas and his successors in office, on the first day of January of each year, one-twentieth of the amount of his obligation or promissory note, with eight per cent, interest on such amount of the principal as may be due at the date of each payment, giving in said obligation such descrip<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion of the land purchased as is contained in his application; provided, that the purchaser may have the privilege of paying the entire amount of the appraised value of said land at the date of purchase, or such amount of principal and interest as may be due at any time subsequent to the execution of his obligation or promissory note; provided, that any pay<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of principal may be deferred for one or more years, except the first one-twentieth, but all payments of both principal and interest must be paid inside of twenty years, and all interest must be paid annually on or before the first day of March of each year. When any land sold under the provisions of this act shall be timbered land, no person shall have the<pb n="214" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="122" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>right to cut and remove any of the timber therefrom until the purchase money has been paid in full.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sec. 2. Whereas, no law is now in force for the disposition of the lands in unorganized counties as contemplated by this act; and whereas, the present session is near its close, therefore an emergency exists and an imperative public necessity is created, that the rule requiring bills to be read on three several days be suspended, that this act take effect from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

<salute>Joint resolution regarding the port of Galveston.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Whereas, the State of Texas, and the States and Territories north and west of it, comprise a vast extent of country possessing great and varied resources which are being developed by a rapidly increasing population, whose immense grain, cotton, and other productions, require cheap and adequate freight communication with the markets of the world, which can not be afforded by long and expensive land carriage, the most impor<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tant interests of producers and consumers demanding a near outlet to water transportation;</p>
<p>And, whereas, the port of Galveston is the nearest practicable port for said region, to the markets of South America, Mexico, Europe, and the Atlantic coast, only requiring, in order to furnish accommodations for all present and future commerce of those States, that its bar be deepened so as to admit vessels drawing over thirteen (13) feet of water;</p>
<p>And, whereas, commercial justice requires that the Federal government should afford proper facilities for the protection and development of the<pb n="218" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="126" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>commerce of the south and west, as well as cultivate trade relations with Mexico and South America;</p>
<p>And, whereas, the improvement of Galveston harbor is a matter of national importance, which fact is being realized, as in part appears from a bill recently introduced in Congress by Mr. M. Price, of Iowa, and Mr. Thomas Ryan, of Kansas, setting forth the necessities for the work and providing for an appropriation of ($1,000,000) one million dollars to be used in deepening the channel over the bar into the harbor of Galveston for admission of ocean steamers drawing twenty-six feet of water, which action is appreciated by the people of Texas; therefore,</p>
<p>Section 1. Be it resolved by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That our senators be instructed and our representatives in Congress be requested to urge by all proper exertions the early passage of said bill, and such other measures having the like object in view, which they may deem expedient, in addition to the current appropriations which their earnest efforts have already secured for that purpose.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. Be it further resolved, That the Legislatures of Kansas, Mis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />souri, Nebraska, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Arkansas, Iowa, and all others that are interested, be and are herby requested to take into consideration the same subject, and take appropriate action for the advancement of their agricultural and commercial interests, by aiding in the accomplishment of this work, by memorializing Congress, and by such other means as they may think advisable.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. Be it further resolved, That the governor of Texas be requested to transmit copies of these resolutions to the governors and Legislatures of the States named, and ask their co-operation, and also to transmit copies hereof to our senators and representatives in Congress.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. The fact that the Legislatures of several of the States mem<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tioned in this resolution are in session, and the Congress of the United States is in session, and is soon to adjourn, and to be effective this reso<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lution should reach said several legislative bodies speedily, creates a pub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lic necessity for the suspension of the rule requiring bills to be read on three several days, and creates an emergency that this resolution should take effect from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>

<p>Whereas, The commissioners heretofore appointed by the governor to make a selection of a plan for the erection of a new capitol, have ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vertised for plans and specifications for the construction of such building, and have a number of such plans now before them, and inasmuch as it is a question of great delicacy and necessarily involves great responsi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />bility, to the end that satisfaction may be assured in their final determin<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ation and in accordance with the recommendation of his excellency the governor and the request of the two building commissioners and the superintending architect, that a skilled and impartial architect be em<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ployed to assist in the examination and selection of plans which shall be subject to the approval of the governor and heads of departments; there<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fore,</p>
<p>Section 1.

<p>Sec. 3. Whereas, it is necessary, to hasten the building of the state capitol, that this resolution should take effect from and after its passage, therefore an emergency exists and an imperative public necessity demands the suspension of the constitutional rule which requires a bill to be read on three several days, therefore that the rule be suspended and that bill take effect and be in force from and after its passage.</p>
