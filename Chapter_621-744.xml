<p>Article 1771. When the district or county attorney shall be informed or have reason to believe that an executor under the will of any person who has died without heirs and without having devised his estate, has not accepted the trust and that no administrator with the will annexed has been appointed; or where such attorney shall discover that no letters of administration on the estate of an intestate who has died without heirs have been granted; or where such attorney finds any estate, real or per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sonal, in the condition specified in the next preceding article (1770) he shall file a petition in behalf of the State in the district court of the county where such property or any part thereof lies, which petition shall set forth a description of the estate, the name of the person last, lawfully seized or possessed of the same, the names of the tenants or persons in actual possession if any, and the names of the persons claiming the estate, if any such are known to claim, and the facts or circumstances in con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sequence of which such estate is claimed to have esheated, praying for a writ of possession for the same in behalf of the State.</p>
<p>Article 1772.

<p>Article 1773. The clerk shall also issue a citation, setting forth briefly the contents of the petition, for all persons interested in the estate to ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pear and answer at the next term of court, which citation shall be pub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lished as required in other civil suits.</p>
<p>Article 1777. If after the issue and trial it appears from the facts found or admitted that the State has good title to the estate, real or per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sonal, in the petition mentioned, or any part thereof, judgment shall be rendered that the State shall be seized or possessed thereof, and at the discretion of the court, recover costs against the defendants.

<p>Article 1780. A writ shall be issued to the sheriff or any constable of the proper county commanding him to seize such estate vested in the State; and if the same be personal property or real estate he shall dispose of the same at public auction in the manner provided by law for the sale of property under execution, and the proceeds, less the costs of court and attorneys&#8217; commissions, be paid into the treasury of the State; pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided that no real estate shall be sold by the sheriff or constable at less than the minimum price to be fixed by the judge before whom the cause was tried, said minimum valuation to be distinctly stated in the advertise<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment, and should there be on the day of sale no bona fide bid for as high an amount as the valuation fixed by the judge before whom the cause was tried there shall be no sale, and the writ shall be immediately re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />turned to the court issuing the same; and thereafter said real estate may be sold by the Attorney-General in the same manner as lands bid in by the State under authority of the act of July 4th, 1879, entitled &#8220;An act to better provide for and facilitate the collection of all judgments in favor of the State or any county thereof&#8221; are now sold by that officer.</p>
<p>Section 2.

Such penalty shall go to the road and bridge fund of the county in which the suit is brought; and it shall be the duty of the county attorney, upon the making of an affidavit of the facts by any person, to at once institute against the company violating the provisions of this act, suit in the proper court to recover such penalty or penalties, and his wilful failure or refusal to do so shall be sufficient cause for his removal from office, unless it is evident that such suit could not have been maintained.
