<p>Article 1. Be it enacted, by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That whereas a long and protracted drouth, beginning in June, A. D. 1885, and continuing with but little intermission up to the present time, has devas[ta]ted a large portion of the State of Texas, whereby many thousands of her citizens are destitute of food, and a great public calamity now exists by reason of said drouth, that the sum of one hundred thousand dollars, or so much thereof as may be necessary, out of any funds now in the State treasury not otherwise appropriated, be and the same is hereby set aside and appropriated for the immediate relief of those suffering from destitution by reason of said drouth.</p>
<p>Art. 2. That the Governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall immediately appoint a committee of three disinterested citizens of the State of Texas, to be known as the Drouth Relief Committee, whose duty it shall be to immediately visit the portions of this State where such desti<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tution prevails, and ascertain the extent of such destitution caused by said drouth; and should said committee upon investigation be satisfied that the people of any county are in destitute circumstances by reason of said drouth, said committee shall draw a draft on the State of Texas, in favor of the<pb n="801" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="3" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>treasurer of such, county, for such sum of money as in the judgment of said com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mittee shall be adequate and proper for the immediate relief of the destitute of such county: Provided, That drafts drawn by the committee shall not exceed in the aggregate the sum herein appropriated.</p>
<p>Art. 3. That said drafts so drawn by said committee shall be endorsed by the Governor, and a warrant issued thereon by the Comptroller to the State Treasurer, and he shall pay the same to the county treasurer in whose favor they are sever<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ally drawn, out of the funds hereinbefore mentioned as set aside for the relief of those suffering from destitution by reason of said drouth, and the county treas<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />urers of such counties shall designate the money so received by them as the relief fund of the county, and shall pay out the same under the order of the commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioners courts of their several counties, as hereinafter provided: Provided, how<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ever, That county treasurer shall receive no commissions for receiving or paying out said money: And provided further, That the county treasurer shall execute a bond, payable to the county judge, to be approved by said county judge, with two or more good and sufficient sureties, in double the amount to be paid into his hands, conditioned that he will faithfully account for and disburse said money.</p>
<p>Art. 4. The commissioners court of any county receiving said, moneys shall im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mediately purchase corn, flour, or meal, at such places and in such manner as to said court may seem proper, and shall distribute the same as a donation to the destitute citizens of their several counties as their immediate necessities may de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mand.</p>
<p>Art. 5. The commissioners court purchasing provisions under the preceding article shall give orders on the county treasurer of said county for money to pay for the same, and in distributing said provisions shall give no aid to any persons who have or are able to buy bread for themselves and shall require affidavits to be made by two credible persons, one of whom may be the party for whom the aid is sought, showing such inability to purchase said food, and that such inability was occasioned by the drouth, and further showing such persons for whom aid is solic<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ited to have been bona fide citizens of the county in which they then reside for more than three months next preceding the time of making such application.</p>
<p>Art. 6. Two members of said drouth relief committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business in this behalf. Said committee shall not be required to visit all of the counties that are suffering from destitution caused by said drouth before furnishing relief, but may in their discretion draw drafts for the relief of the people of the counties in succession as visited by them, so as to give them immediate relief, having due regard for the probable number of people to be relieved and the amount herein appropriated to be drawn from.</p>
<p>Art. 7. Said drouth relief committee shall procure information, concerning the extent of said drouth and the destitution caused thereby, and make a full report of the same with such suggestions as to them may seem proper, together with a full report of their action, to this Legislature, by or before the 15th of March, 1887.</p>
<p>Art. 8. The members of said drouth relief committee shall each receive the sum of five dollars per day for each day actually engaged in the dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />charge of their duties as required by this act, and all actual necessary ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />penses incurred by them: Provided, That no members of said committee shall receive pay for more than forty days services, an accurate itemized account of which said actual necessary expenses and per diem services of each member shall be made under oath by said members, approved by the Governor, and presented to the Comptroller of the State of Texas, who shall<pb n="802" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="4" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>thereupon issue a warrant for the same, and the State Treasurer shall pay the same out of the said sum set aside for the immediate relief of those suffering by reason of said drouth.</p>
<p>Art. 9. Each member of the drouth relief committee, before entering upon the discharge of his duties as such, shall take and subscribe an oath to faithfully and impartially discharge his duties as a member of the drouth relief committee, which said oath shall be filed in the office of the Secretary of State.</p>
<p>Art. 10. Whereas great distress, owing to said destitution by said drouth, now prevails in a large portion of this State, therefore there is an imperative public necessity that the rule requiring bills to be read on three several days be suspended, and an emergency exists requiring this act to be in force from and after its pas<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sage and it is so enacted.</p>

<p>Whereas, under an act of the Legislature of this State providing for the sale of State school lands, approved April 24, 1874, and an act of the Legislature of this State providing for the sale of the asylum lands of the State, approved April 25, 1874, many of said lands were sold on a credit of ten years, the principal bearing ten per cent interest per annum; and</p>
<p>Whereas, many of the obligations given for said lands are now about to become due, and said purchase money is bringing to the State a higher rate of interest than can be otherwise obtained for the same sum; and</p>
<p>Whereas, it is to the interest of the State school fund, and other funds to which such lands belong, that the time for the payment of said principal purchase money be extended: Therefore,</p>

Whereas, many of said obligations will fall due on the first day of March, 1887, and whereas it is to the interest of the State that said principal sums yet unpaid should be left unpaid so long as the same will bring ten per cent interest, and whereas many of the said purchasers will be compelled to make great sacrifices to secure the money to pay said obligations if compelled to pay the same when due, therefore an imperative public necessity exists for the immedi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ate passage of this bill, and that it take effect from passage; therefore the consti<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days is hereby suspended, and it is enacted that this bill take effect from and after its passage.</p>

<p>Whereas, on the night of 12th day of October, A.

Within the compass of a few moments the houses and the house furniture of all those mentioned in this act were crushed and swept away. Eighty-six persons were drowned immediately, and a great many seriously wounded or maimed, and the balance barely escaped with their lives.

<salute>An Act to authorize counties, cities, and towns in this State which have issued bonds to aid in the construction of railroads and other internal improvements, to adjust their rate of taxation so as to provide for the payment of the interest and sinking fund upon the same.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Whereas, in some of the counties, cities, and towns of this State there is an existing bonded indebtedness against the same, necessitating the collection of taxes to pay interest and sinking fund both due and to become due, and necessitating the collection from the people thereof taxes that are past due; and,</p>
<p>Whereas, in some of those counties, cities, and towns, by reason of the increased value of the property and the reduction of the debt by the payment of the sinking fund, the rate of taxation has become disproportionate to the amount to be paid, requiring a larger amount to be collected from the people annually than is neces<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sary for the payment of the interest and sinking fund aforesaid: Therefore,</p>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That the county commissioners court of any county, or the mayor and board of aldermen or city council of any city or town, that have heretofore issued bonds to aid in the construction of railroads or other works of internal improvement, are hereby au<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />thorized and empowered to reduce the rate of taxation heretofore levied for the purpose of paying interest and sinking fund on such bonds, so as to raise the amount necessary to pay the said interest and sinking fund which may become due annually according to the terms of the said bonds; and any county, city, or town, by its said commissioners, or city council, or mayor and aldermen, may from time to time hereafter increase or diminish its rate of taxation according to the valuation of its taxable property, so as to raise the amount necessary for the payment of the said interest and sinking fund annually: Provided, That the taxes shall never be reduced below the rate that will raise the amount that is annually due upon such bonds.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. The levy of tax provided for in the preceding section shall be made upon the assessed value of the property of such county, city or town for the previous year, and shall remain in force from year to year until there has been a new levy, according to the provisions of this act. It shall be the duty of the officer who shall make the assessments annually for such county, city or town to make the levy of cthe taxes aforesaid upon the assessment of property made for general purposes, and to so return his rolls as to show the said tax due from each person the same as the other taxes are shown. No additional fees shall be allowed for said work. For col<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lecting the said taxes the tax collector of such county, city or town shall receive one and one-half per cent upon the amount collected.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. The fact that the time for the collection of taxes is approaching, creates a public necessity that this act should be put in force at once, and<pb n="828" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="30" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>that the rule requiring that this bill should be read three several days should be suspended, and the said rules are so suspended, and that this act shall take effect from and after its passage.</p>

<p>Section 1.

<opener>
<salute>An Act to authorize any city or town in this State to compromise existing indebtedness, and to issue new bonds to be sold or ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />changed for this purpose, and to provide for the efficient collection of taxes to pay the principal and interest of such new bonds, and to provide for the appoint<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of receivers for said municipal corporations during the pendency of nego<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tiations for such compromise.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Whereas in some of the cities and towns of this State there is an existing in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />debtedness against the same necessitating the collection of an excessive tax upon the people to pay the interest and provide a sinking fund as required by law for the ultimate extinguishment of said indebtedness,</p>
<p>And whereas it is believed a satisfactory adjustment, settlement and compro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mise of much of said indebtedness could be effected between said cities and towns and the holders of such indebtedness if duly authorized by law, by which such in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />debtedness would be greatly reduced and taxation necessary to meet the same greatly lessened in amount;</p>
<p>And whereas the accomplishment of this adjustment, settlement and compromise is a great public necessity which requires the rules to be suspended that this act may become a law at the present session of the Legislature, and that it take ef<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fect and be in force from and after its passage: Therefore,</p>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: Thai the mayor and board of aldermen of any city or town in this State are hereby author<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ized and empowered, by resolution or ordinance of said board of aldermen reciting the caption of this act and adopting the same, do compromise and fund any ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />isting valid indebtedness by such city or town issued, whether bonded or floating, and the coupons due upon the bonded debt; and for this purpose they are hereby authorized and empowered to issue new bonds, in denomination of not less than fifty nor more than one thousand dollars, in their discretion, with interest coupons payable semi-annually at the office of the State Treasurer of at such other place as said boards of aldermen shall provide; said new bonds to become due and pay<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />able in not exceeding thirty years, and to bear such rate of interest, not exceeding six per cent per annum, as in their discretion may best subserve the purpose in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tended by this act.</p>
<pb n="849" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="51" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>
<p>Sec. 2. No compromise shall be made under the provisions of this act by which any debt shall be funded which is now barred by the statute of limitations, or which may be barred at the time of such compromise.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. The new bonds thus issued by any city or town shall be exempt from the payment of all taxes levied by such city or town, and the taxes levied to pay said new bonds may be paid in said bonds or coupons thereof if matured: Provided, That Said coupons and bonds shall only be received in payment of taxes levied for the purpose of paying such bonds and coupons.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. That the mayor and board of aldermen shall cause to be prepared the necessary blank bonds to give effect to the provisions of this act, the cost of which shall be paid out of the treasurer [treasury] of such city or town; said bonds when issued by any city or town shall be signed by the mayor and attested by the secretary (or recorder if there be no secretary), with the seal of such city or town affixed; and such new bonds, whether issued by any city or town, shall be regis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tered in the office of the State Comptroller.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. Such new bonds may be exchanged for the old bonds, or they may be sold-and the proceeds applied to the purchase of such old bonds: Provided, That no delivery of such new shall take place unless a contract has already been entered into for the purchase of a corresponding amount of such old bonds: And provided further, No bond&#8217;s issued under this act shall be sold at less than par, and each bond shall be made to bear the lowest rate of interest that will give a par value.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. That all laws now in force providing for the collection of taxes for the payment of the principal and interest of such existing bonds shall apply and be in force for the collection of taxes for the payment of the principal and interest of Such new bonds: Provided, That the sinking fund may be used in the purchase and cancellation of such new bonds whenever the same can be bought at not more than their oar value.</p>
<p>Sec. 7. The object and intention of this act being to enable the cities or towns in this State which have granted subsidy bonds to railroads or other works of in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ternal improvement, or created any other indebtedness whatever, whether bonded or floating, to compromise the same, and thereby reduce the burden of taxation, it is hereby declared, as an inducement to the holders of said bonds to accept the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />promise, that whenever such compromise shall be entered into and accepted in good faith either by the holders of the present bonds or by any persons purchasing such new bonds as provided in this act, that all laws now in force or which may hereafter be in force for the assessment and collection of the State taxes shall also be in force and apply to the assessment and collection of the taxes levied to meet the in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />terest and sinking fund of said new bonds; and in any suits which may hereafter be instituted to enforce the payment of said new bonds or coupons against any such city or town, no defense either in law or equity shall be admitted in any of the courts of this State except such as originated upon or subsequent to the issuance of such new bonds.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. Whenever a collector of taxes shall neglect or refuse to collect the taxes levied for the payment of the interest and sinking fund of such new bonds, he shall be liable on his official bond, at the suit of any persons holding any of said bonds or coupons, for all such damages as said person or persons shall have sustained by reason of his neglect or refusal; nor shall such collector or his sureties be relieved of such liability by his resignation of the office; and whenever any person who may be elected collector of taxes of any city or town shall fail, neglect, or refuse to give the bond required<pb n="850" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="52" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>by law for the collection of such tax, or whenever the mayor and board of aldermen shall appoint any person who shall fail, neglect, or refuse to give said bond, or whenever they shall fail, neglect, or refuse to appoint some person who will give said bond and collect said tax, then it is-hereby made the duty of the Governor to appoint some suitable person to collect said taxes, who shall perform all the duties required by this act or any other laws of this State relating -to the collection of said taxes, from the term of his said appointment until the next general election.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. That whenever a compromise of the debt of any city or town shall be effected as hereinbefore provided, and the bond&#8217;s are delivered to the creditors. a board of liquidation, consisting of five reputable citizens of such city or town, shall be appointed forthwith in the manner following: The mayor of the city or town shall appoint one, the Governor of the State shall appoint one, and the dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />trict judge of the district in which such city or town shall be situated shall appoint one, the city council of the city or town shall appoint one, and the holders of said indebtedness, or a majority of them, shall appoint one, and each shall fill vacancies in the office of their respective appointees in said board; and in case of failure, neglect, or refusal of any one or all of said officers to ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />point a member of said board, or to fill vacancies therein, then the holders of said bonds, or any one or more of them, shall have the right to apply to the district court of the district in which such city or town shall be situated, or to the judge thereof in vacation, for the appointment of a member or members of said board necessary to complete the same, and it shall be the duty of said court or judge to make said appointment. The members of said board shall serve without compensa<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion, and shall hold their offices for the term of four years and until their succes<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sors are appointed and qualified. Each member of said board shall take an oath to faithfully perform the duties of his office. A majority of the board shall consti<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tute a quorum for the transaction of business. Said board, or a majority thereof, shall select some solvent depositary for all moneys coming under their control, as hereinafter provided, and for whose acts they shall be responsible, and shall, in writ<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing signed by them, notify the collector of taxes of said city or town of said selec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion. It shall thereupon become the duty of such collector to deposit at the close of business each day one-half of all moneys collected by him for the twenty-four hours next preceding on account of all the taxes of whatever nature levied by said city or town with the said depositary, whose receipt therefor shall be an acquit<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tance to said collector; and said collectors shall be liable on their official bonds for any failure to promptly make such deposits, and for ten per cent per month, of such amounts and in addition thereto as penalty, which sums may be recovered by said board of liquidation in a suit therefor, and it shall be their duty to promptly institute such suits. But whenever the total of such deposits shall equal the an<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nual interest on the said bonds it shall be lawful for such collector to discontinue said deposits until he shall be notified in writing by said board that said deposits are reduced below that sum. Said funds of cities or towns shall be subject to the order of said boards of liquidation, and shall be applied by them to the payment, first, of the interest on said bonds as the same matures, and, sec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ondly, to the payment of the principal thereof. The members of said board shall be liable for the prompt payment of said interest out of said funds, and in case of failure or refusal they shall in addition be liable to ten per cent of the amount of such interest as damages, to be recovered by any person aggrieved thereby, in any court of competent jurisdiction. Whenever there shall be in the hands of such depositaries a sufficient sum<pb n="851" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="53" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>to pay two per cent of the principal of said bonds in addition to one and one-half years interest, it shall be the duty of said board of liquidation to use the same in the purchase of outstanding bonds as provided in section six of this act, which bonds when so purchased shall be cancelled, and shall, together with all coupons which have been paid, be returned to the council of the city or town. Expenses incurred by said board in advertising for purchase of bonds shall be paid out of said funds. Said boards shall make semi-annual report to the said councils of their acts and of all receipts and disbursements of moneys coming under their control.</p>
<p>Sec. 10. That any city or town so situated as is herein set forth, which fails to accomplish a compromise of its debts, or pending the negotiation of a compromise, shall be permitted, on its application setting forth its financial condition and insol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vency, to have the district court of the county in which said city or town is sit<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />uated take charge of the collection and appropriation of all taxes levied and as<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sessed by said city or town, except so much thereof as is necessary to pay the cur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rent expenses of the city or town; and to that end said court, or the judge thereof in vacation, shall appoint a receiver, or may make the assessor and collector of said city or town its receiver, to collect and pay into a named depository all taxes levied by said city or town for the payment of its debts; and said courts shall de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cide all questions of priority between conflicting claimants of said funds; and shall provide for the ratable and equitable distribution of said funds among all creditors entitled thereto. But it shall not be lawful for any court to appoint a receiver of or concerning any city or town except upon the voluntary application of such city or town.</p>
<p>Sec. 11. That this act shall not be construed to repeal an act entitled &#8220;An Act to authorize counties, cities, and towns to scale and fund their indebtedness, and for raising means to pay the same,&#8221; approved March 25, A. D. 1879, except in so far as said act may apply to bonds issued under an act entitled &#8220;An Act to author<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ize counties, cities, and towns to aid in the construction of railroads and other works of internal improvement,&#8221; approved April 12, 1871, and to that extent it is hereby repealed; nor shall this act be construed to repeal an act entitled &#8220;An Act to authorize any county, city, or town in this State to compromise existing bonded indebtedness, and to issue new bonds to be sold or exchanged for this purpose, and to provide for the efficient collection of taxes to pay the principal and interest of such new bonds.&#8221; approved April 18, 1879.</p>
<p>Sec. 12. The fact that compromises may be made under this bill at an early date, and that agreements to that effect are practically pending at this time, and of great importance, causes an emergency to exist which requires this act to take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>
<p>Sec. 13. The near approach of the close of the sesison creates an imperative public necessity and emergency demanding the suspension of the constitutional rule requiring a bill to be read on three several days, and such rule is hereby sus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pended.</p>

For the purpose of carrying out the compromise or ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />justment hereby authorized, the said counties, cities, and towns are authorized to issue bonds, in denominations of not less than one hundred nor more than one thousand dollars each, for an amount sufficient to consummate such compromise or adjustment, not to exceed the amount unpaid on the outstanding bonds.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. The bonds authorized by the preceding section may be exchanged for the bonds heretofore issued, or they may be sold and the proceeds used to buy up the old bonds as it may be necessary: Provided, that the said bonds shall not be exchanged for the old bonds at a greater rate than par, except that the old bonds may be taken at a discount, and the new at the face value, according to agree<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment: And provided, That the new bonds issued under this act shall not be sold for less than the amount for which the old bonds can be purchased. No bond&#8217;s shall be sold under this act until there has been a contract by which the proceeds can be invested in the purchase of the old bonds.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. If any county, city, or town shall desire to avail itself of this act, and when arrangements shall have been made for the compromise or ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />justment of any of the bonds as hereinbefore mentioned, the commissioners court of such county, or the city council of such town or city, shall enter an order, or adopt an ordinance, as the case may be, authorizing the issuance of bonds, which shall prescribe the amount to be issued, and shall cause blank bonds to be prepared for the purpose aforesaid. The bonds shall be made payable to bearer, and shall be payable such time after date as may be fixed and agreed upon, not to exceed fifty years, and shall bear such rate of interest as may be agreed upon, which shall not exceed the rate of interest that the old bonds now bear. The interest may be made payable annually<pb n="876" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="78" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>or semi-annually, and at such place as may be specified. Coupons shall be at<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tached, representing each installment of interest as specified, which shall also in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />clude two per cent of the face of the bond as a sinking fund.

<p>Sec. 4. The bonds as herein authorized to be issued may be exchanged or sold from time to time, and in such amounts as can be procured of the old bonds by purchase or exchange. Whenever any bonds shall be issued, the county com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioners court, or council of such city or town, shall levy upon the last assess<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of the property for such city or town, as the case may be, a tax suffi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cient to pay the interest and sinking fund of not less than two per cent upon such bonds. The tax so levied shall remain as the levy for that purpose until a new levy may be made for that purpose: Provided, That such commissioners court or council may from time to time increase or diminish such tax so as to ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />just the same to the taxable values of the property of the county or city or town and the amount to be collected: Provided further, That the amount shall not any time be reduced so that it will mot raise an amount sufficient to pay the annual interest and sinking fund on all the bonds sold or exchanged under this act.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. If the tax collector, or any officer charged with the duty of collecting the tax levied to pay the interest and sinking fund upon said bonds, shall refuse to collect the said tax at any time, he shall be liable upon his official bond to any person who may be injured thereby. If any collector shall refuse to collect said taxes, then upon the complaint of any citizen or person interested, or upon their own motion, it shall be the duty of the commissioners court of such county, or the city council of such city or town, to appoint some suitable person, who shall qualify as required of the collector aforesaid, and shall proceed to collect Said tax until the next general election and until a collector shall be elected and qualified who will collect the same. If a commissioners court or council aforesaid shall fail or refuse to appoint some person as aforesaid, then the Governor of the State shall make such appointment of some suitable person who shall collect said taxes until the next general election and until some collector shall be elected who will collect the same; and such person so appointed by the Governor shall qualify as the regular collector is or may be required by law.</p>
<p>Sec. 6.

<p>Sec. 3. As soon as may be practicable after the passage and approval of this act, the Commissioner of the General Land Office shall cause all the lands belonging to the several funds named in this act, which may be in demand for immediate settlement, to be carefully and skillfully classified<pb n="882" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="84" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>and valued; and for this purpose he may appoint, with the approval of the Governor, such number of competent State agents as may be necessary to effect such classification and valuation; and he shall cause such classification and valua<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion to be made of the remainder of such lands from time to time as the same may come into demand for actual settlement; and with the approval of the Gov<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ernor he may allow such compensation to said State agents as may be just and proper, not to exceed the sum of one hundred and fifty dollars per month and necessary expenses for subsistence.

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas. That two new counties, one to be called Sutton County, and one to be called Schleicher County, are hereby created out of the county of Crockett, with boundaries as follows:</p>
<p>Sutton County. Beginning at the northwest corner of the county of Kimble; thence west fifty miles; thence south to the north boundary line of the county of Val Verde; thence east following the said north boundary line of Val Verde County to the northeast corner of same; thence east to the southwest corner of Kimble County; thence north with the west boundary line of said Kimble County to the place of beginning.</p>
<p>Schleicher County: Beginning at the northwest corner of the county of Menard; thence west with the south boundary line of Tom Green County fifty miles; thence south to the northwest corner of Sutton County; thence east with the north boundary line of Sutton County to the southwest comer of Menard County; thence north with the west boundary line of Menard County to the place of be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ginning.</p>

<p>Article 3227. The commissioners court of each county in the State whenever they deem it expedient, may order an election to be held by the qualified voters of said county, or of any justices precinct, town, or city therein, to determine whether or not the sale of intoxicating liquors shall be prohibited in such county, justices precinct, town, or city: Provided, It shall be the duty of said commissioners court to order the election aforesaid whenever petitioned to do so by as many as two hundred voters in any county, or fifty voters in any justices precinct, town, or city, as the case may be.</p>
<p>Article 3228. The preceding article shall not be construed to prohibit the sale of wines for sacramental purposes, nor alcoholic stimulants as medicines in cases of actual sickness, but such stimulants shall only be sold upon the prescription of a regular practicing physician, written in ink, dated and signed by him, and certified on his honor that he (the physician) has personally examined the appli<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cant (naming him), and that he finds him actually sick, and in need of the stim<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ulant prescribed as a medicine: Provided, That a physician who does not follow the profession of medicine as his principal and usual calling, or who is in any way, directly or indirectly, engaged or interested in the sale of such stimulants on his own account, or as the agent, employe, or partner of others, shall not be authorized to give the prescription provided for in this article: And provided further, That no person shall be permitted to sell more than once on the same prescription, nor shall any person be permitted to sell at all on the prescription of a physician not herein authorized to give it, nor on a prescription which is not dated, signed, and certified, as above required: Provided, That every person selling such stimulants upon the prescription herein provided for, shall cancel such prescription by in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dorsing thereon the word &#8220;cancelled,&#8221; and file the same away.</p>
<p>Article 3229. When the commissioners court, of their own motion, or upon the petition provided for in Article 3227, shall order the election as herein provided for, it shall be the duty of said court to order such election to be held at the regular voting place, or places, within the proposed limits,<pb n="895" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="97" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>upon a day not less than fifteen nor more than thirty days from the date of said order, and the order thus made shall express the object of such election, and shall be held to be prima facie evidence that all the provisions of law necessary to give its validity, or to clothe the court with jurisdiction to make it, have been fully complied with.</p>
<p>Article 3230. The clerk of said court shall post, or cause to be posted, at least five copies of said order at different places within the proposed limits, for at least twelve days prior to the day of election, which election shall be held and the returns thereof made in conformity with the provisions of the general election laws of the State, and by the officers of election appointed and qualified under such laws.</p>
<p>Article 3233. Said court shall hold a special session on the eleventh day after the holding of said election, or as soon thereafter as practicable, for the purpose of opening the polls and counting the votes; and if a majority of the votes east are &#8220;For Prohibition," said court shall immediately make an order declaring the result of said vote, and absolutely prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors within the prescribed limits, except for the purposes and under the regulations specified in this title, until such time as the qualified voters therein may at a legal election held for that purpose by a majority vote decide otherwise. And the order thus made shall be held to be prima facie evidence that all the provisions of law have been complied with in giving notice of and holding said election, and in counting and returning the votes and declaring the result thereof.</p>
<p>Article 3234. The order of court declaring the result, and prohibiting the sale of such liquors, shall be published for four successive weeks in some newspaper published in the county wherein such election has been held, which newspaper shall be selected by the county judge for that purpose. If there be no newspaper published in the county, then the county judge shall cause such publication to be made by posting copies of said order at three public places within the prescribed limits of the aforesaid length of time. The fact of publication in either mode shall be entered by the county judge on the minutes of the commissioners court; and entry thus made, or a copy thereof certified under the hand and seal of the clerk of the county court, shall be held sufficient prima facie evidence of such fact of publication.</p>
<p>Article 3236. No election under the preceding articles shall be held within the same prescribed limits in less than two years after an election under this title has been held therein; but at the expiration of that time the commissioners court of each county in the State, whenever they deem it expedient, may order another election to be held by the qualified voters of said county, or of any justices pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cinct, town, or city therein, for the same purpose: Provided, It shall be the duty of such court to order the election aforesaid whenever petitioned to do so by as many as two hundred voters in any county, or fifty voters in any justices precinct, town, or city, as the case may be, to order an election for the same purpose, which election shall be ordered held, notice thereof given, the votes returned and counted, and the result declared and published, in all respects as provided by this title for a first election; and the order granting such other election, as well as that declaring the result, shall, if prohibition be earned, have the same force and effect, and the same conclusiveness, as are given to them in the case of a first election by the provisions of this title.</p>
<p>Article 3238. The. failure to carry prohibition in a county shall not prevent an election for the same from being immediately thereafter held in a justices precinct, town, or city of said county: nor shall the failure to<pb n="896" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="98" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>carry prohibition in a town or city prevent an election from being immediately thereafter held for the entire justices precinct or county in which said town or city is situated; nor shall the holding of an election in a justices precinct in any way prevent the holding of an election immediately thereafter for the entire county in which such justices precinct is situated; but when prohibition has been carried at an election ordered for the entire county, no election on the question of prohibition shall be thereafter ordered in any justices precinct, town, or city of said county until after prohibition has been defeated at a subsequent election for the same purpose, ordered and held for the entire county, in accordance with the provisions of this title; nor in any case where prohibition has carried in any justices precinct shall an election on the question of prohibition be ordered there<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />after in any town or city in such precinct until after prohibition has been defeated at a subsequent election ordered and held for such entire precinct. Article 3239a. At any time within thirty days after the result of the election has been declared, any qualified voter of the county, justices precinct, town, or city in which such election has been held, may contest the said election in any court of competent jurisdiction, in such manner as has been or may hereafter be provided; and should it appear from the evidence that the election was illegally or fraudulently conducted; or that by the action or want of action on the part of the officers to whom was intrusted the control of such election, such a number of legal voters were denied the privilege of voting, as had they been allowed to vote might have materially changed the result; or if it appears from the evidence that such irregularities existed as to render the true result of the election im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />possible to be arrived at, or very doubtful of ascertaining, the court shall adjudge such election to be void, and shall order the proper officer to order another elec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion to be held, and shall cause a certified copy of such judgment and order of the court to be delivered to such officer upon whom is devolved by law the duty of ordering such election.</p>

<p>Whereas, on the first day of July, A.

<p>1. In an action by a vendor to vacate a fraudulent purchase of property, or by a creditor to subject any property or fund to his claim, or between partners or others jointly owning or interested in any property or fund, on the application of the plaintiff or any party whose right to or interest in the property or fund or the proceeds thereof is probable, and where it is shown that the property or fund is in danger of being lost, removed, or materially injured.</p>

<p>3. In cases where a corporation has been dissolved, or is insolvent, or in im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />minent danger of insolvency, or has forfeited its corporate rights.</p>
<p>4. In all other cases where receivers have heretofore been appointed by the usages of the court of equity.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. No party, attorney, or person interested in an action shall be appointed receiver therein, nor shall any person be appointed receiver in any case where the property lies within this State unless he is a bona fide citizen of the State of Texas and qualified to vote.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. When a receiver is appointed he shall, before he enters upon his duties, be sworn to perform them faithfully, and shall execute a bond, with three or more good and sufficient sureties, to be approved by the court appointing him, in such sum as the court shall see proper to fix, conditioned that he will faithfully dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />charge all of the duties of receiver in the action (naming it) and obey the orders of the court therein.</p>
<p>Sec. 4.

<p>Sec. 5. The funds in the hands of a receiver may be invested upon interest by order of the court, but no such order shall be made except upon consent of all of the parties to the action.</p>
<p>Sec. 6.

<p>Sec. 7. When a line of a railroad operated by a receiver lies wholly within this State, all money which comes into the hands of the receiver, whether from operating the road or otherwise, shall be kept and deposited in such place within this State as the court may direct, until propely disbursed; but if any portion of the road lies in another State the receiver shall be required to deposit (in this State at least such share of the funds in his hands as is proportioned to the value of the property of the company within this State.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. When any property of any kind within the limits of this State has been placed, by order of court, in the hands of a receiver, who has taken charge of such property, such receiver may, in his official capacity, sue or be sued in any court of this State having jurisdiction of the cause of action, without first having obtained leave of the court appointing such receiver to bring said suit, and if a judgment is recovered against said receiver it shall be the duty of the court to order said judgment paid out of any funds in the hands of said receiver as such receiver.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. Actions may be brought against the receiver of the property of any person where said person resides.

<p>Sec. 10. The court shall, in every case of the appointment of receiver, also after his qualifying, appoint a master in chancery, who shall be a citizen of this State, and not an attorney for either party to the action, nor related to either party, who shall perform all of the duties required of him by the court, and shall be under orders of the court, and have such power as a master of chancery has in a court of equity.</p>

<p>Sec. 12. When a person resides within this State and a receiver is applied for, or if the property sought to be placed in the hands of a receiver is situated within the limits of this State, no court other than one within the limits of this State shall have power to appoint any receiver of said property.</p>

<p>Section 61. When a school district or community has no school house or not a sufficient number, or when the school houses are in need of repairs or furniture, so much of the available public free school fund to the credit of such district or community for any one year as the county judge may deem expedient or neces<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sary, may be used for erecting, repairing, or furnishing a house or houses, as the case may be: Provided, That where a house is to be erected, the citizens of the district or community must contribute of their labor or means, or both, an amount equal to one-third of the school fund so used, and a suitable piece of land shall be donated as a site, and a deed therefor shall be executed and delivered, conveying a good and sufficient title in fee simple in and to such land, to the county judge and his successors in office in trust for public free school purposes, which deed must be recorded as other deeds: And provided further, That districts which have taxed or may hereafter tax themselves, may be allowed to use the money raised by such taxation for the purpose of purchasing, repairing, enlarging erecting, or furnishing school buildings, or to purchase building sites, but the title to all real estate so purchased shall be taken and recorded as herein above provided.</p>

<p>Sec. 2. The act above mentioned shall be further amended by adding thereto another section, to be known as section 43a, which shall read as follows:</p>
<p>Section 43a. The office of county superintendent of public instruction is hereby created, and the county commissioners court of any county in this State may, when in their judgment it may be advisable, provide for the election at each general election of some person of educational attainments, good moral character, and executive ability, a qualified voter of said county, and the holder of a first grade teacher&#8217;s certificate, who shall hold his office for the term of two years, and until his successor is elected and qualified; and said commissioners court, when they so provide for the election of a county superintendent, shall appoint a county superintendent of public instruction, with the qualifications above pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided, who shall perform the duties of such office until a county superintendent shall have been elected, as hereinbefore provided, and shall have: qualified. Such county superintendent of public instruction shall perform all the duties in regard to the public free schools of his county imposed by law upon the county judges of such counties as have no county superintendents of public instruction, and shall have and may exercise all powers and authority vested by law in such county judges in respect to matters appertaining to the public free schools; and in addition thereto he shall take the scholastic census of his county, which census shall be taken by districts in those counties wherein the district system prevails, and under the rules and regulations of Section 40 of tins act. Such county super<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />intendent, before entering upon the discharge of his duties, shall take the oath of office prescribed by law for school officers, and shall enter into bond in the sum of five thousand dollars, with good and sufficient security, to be approved by the county commissioners court, and to be filed with the county clerk of his county; and said bond shall be made payable to the county commissioners court and their successors in office in trust for the permanent school fund of the county, and be conditioned for the faithful performance of the duties of his office. Said county superintendent shall receive the same compensation for his services, to be paid in the same way, as is allowed by law to the county judges for similar services, and also the compensation allowed by law for taking the scholastic census, and such other compensation as may be allowed by the commissioners court of his county, to be paid from the school fund: Provided, The said compensation shall never exceed in the aggregate one thousand dollars per annum. He shall have authority to administer all oaths necessary for the proper discharge of all the duties required of him. Said county superintendent shall keep his office in the county seat, and to him shall be made all applications and reports authorized and required by law to be made to county judges in respect to public free school matters in those coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ties having no county superintendents of public instruction.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. Whereas the near approach of the close of the present session of the Legislature renders it doubtful whether this act can be passed if al<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lowed to take the regular course in both houses; and whereas it is a mat<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ter of great importance that many grave defects in the present school law sought to be remedied hereby should be corrected; and whereas, in order that certain provisions of this act should be complied with according to its<pb n="925" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="127" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>terms, it is necessary that it should take effect and be in force from and after its passage; therefore an imperative public necessity and emergency exist requiring the suspension of the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days in each house, and that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.</p>
<p>[Note.&#8212;The foregoing act originated in the House, and passed the same by a vote of 72 yeas, 12 nays; and massed the Senate by a vote of 20 yeas. 6 nays.]</p>

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted, by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That there shall be established an asylum for the deaf land dumb and the blind of the youth of the people of color in this State. It shall be the duty of the Governor of this State immediately after the passage of this act to appoint three Commissioners to select a suitable site for said asylum; said site to be at or near the city of Austin, and shall not be less in extent than four acres of ground.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. Said board, after the selection of said site, shall be authorized to purchase the same, and to draw their draft on the Treasurer of the State, to be approved by the Governor, for the payment of the same; and shall have plans and specifications for said buildings prepared and said board shall advertise for bids for the building and completion of the same.

<p>Article 1054. To the sheriff or constable shall be allowed the following fees, in all cases where the charge is a felony, whether the defendant be convicted or acquitted, or the case be disposed of by nolle prosequi, or upon judgment of dismissal.</p>
<p>1. For executing each warrant of arrest or capias, or for making arrest without warrant, the sum of one dollar.</p>

<p>Sec. 2. The near approach of the close of the session of the Legislature, and the impossibility to have this act read on three several days in each house, creates an imperative public necessity, and an emergency exists requiring the suspension of the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days, and that this bill be placed upon its immediate passage, and said rule is so suspended.</p>

<salute>An Act creating boards of equalization for cities and towns, and denning their duties.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That the city councils of the several cities and towns of this State incorporated under the general laws shall annually, at their first meeting, or as soon thereafter as practicable, appoint three commissioners, each being a qualified voter, a resident, and property owner of the city or town for which he is appointed, who shall be styled the board of equalization, and at the same meeting said council shall by ordinance fix the time for the meeting of such board of equalization.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. The board of equalization shall convene annually, at the time fixed by the city council, to receive all the assessment lists or books of the assessor of their city, for examination, correction, equalization, appraisement, and approval, and at all meeting&#8217;s of said board the city secretary shall act as secretary thereof.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. The board, of equalization shall cause the assessor to bring be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fore them at the time toed for the convening of said board, all the as<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sessment lists or books of the assessor of their city, for their examination, that they may see if each and every person has rendered his property at a fair market value; and said board shall have power to send for persons and papers, to swear and qualify persons who testify, to ascertain the value of such property; and if they are satisfied it is too high, they shall lower it to<pb n="951" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="153" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>its proper value; and if too low, they shall raise the value of such property to a proper figure. Said board shall also have power to correct any errors that may ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pear on the assessor&#8217;s lists or books.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. The board of equalization shall equalize as near as possible the value of all the improved lots within the corporate limits of their city, having reference to the size and location of said lots and the improvements thereon, and shall equal<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ize the value of unimproved lots as near as possible, having reference to the size and location thereof, and all other property of the same kind shall be made as nearly equal as possible. Any person may file with said board at any time before the final action of said board a complaint as to the assessment of his or any other person&#8217;s property, and said board shall hear said complaint, and said complainant shall have the right to have witnesses summoned in sustaining said complaint as to the insurance on said property, or the rents and profits it may bring the holder thereof.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. The city assessor at the same time that he delivers to said board his lists and books, as provided in section three of this act. shall also furnish to said board a certified list of the names of all persons who either refuse to swear or qualify or to sign the oath or affirmation as required by law, together with a list of the property of such persons situated within the corporate limits of their city, as made by Em through other information, and said board shall examine said lists and appraise the property so listed by the assessor.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. In all cases where the board of equalization shall find their duty to raise the value of any property appearing on the lists or books of the assessor, they shall, after having fully examined such lists or books and corrected all errors appearing therein, adjourn to a day not less than ten nor more than fifteen days from the date of adjournment, such day to be fixed in the order of adjournment, and Shall cause the secretary of said board to give written notice to the owner of such property or to the person rendering the same of the time to which said board may have adjourned, and that such owner or person rendering the said property may at that time appear and show cause why the value of said property should not be raised, which notice may be served by depositing the same, properly addressed and postage paid, in the city postoffice.</p>
<p>Sec. 7. The board of equalization shall meet at the time specified in said order of adjournment, and shall hear all persons the value of whose property has been raised, and if said board is satisfied they have raised the value of such property too high they shall lower the sarnie to its proper value.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. The board of equalization, after they have rurally examined and equalized the value of all property on the assessor&#8217;s lists or books, shall approve said lists or books and return them together with the lists mentioned in section live of this act, that he may make up therefrom his general rolls as required by law; and when said general rolls are so made up the board shah meet again to examine said rolls and approve the same if found correct.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. The action of said board at the meeting provided for in section seven of this act shall be final, and shall not be subject to revision by said board or by any other tribunal thereafter.</p>
<p>Sec. 10. The members of the board of equalization and the city secretary while acting as secretary of said board shall receive such compensation for their serv<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ices, to be allowed by the city council, as said council may deem just and reason<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />able.</p>
<p>Sec. 11. Before said board shall enter upon their duties they shall be sworn, by any officer authorized by law to administer oaths, to faithfully<pb n="952" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="154" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>and impartially discharge all duties incumbent upon them by law as such board.</p>
<p>Sec. 12. All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this act are hereby repealed.</p>
<p>Sec. 13. An imperative public necessity and emergency exist that this act pass and take effect at once; it is therefore enacted that the rule requiring this act to be read on three several days be suspended, and that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage.</p>
<p>[Note.&#8212;The foregoing act was presented to the Governor for his approval on the 4th day of April, A.
