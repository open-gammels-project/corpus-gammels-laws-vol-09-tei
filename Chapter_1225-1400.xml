If the amount of such compensation cannot be agreed upon, the land desired may be condemned by a board of four disinter<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ested appraisers, each of whom shall be a freeholder and legal voter in the city, two of whom shall be chosen by the mayor, and two by the property owners inter<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ested, from a panel of eight qualified persons duly summoned by the mayor for such purpose. The mayor shall cause the property owners to be notified of the time and place of the meeting to select said board and request them to be present.

Said report shall not be void for want of form or misdescription of property, but the council may cause the same to be corrected. The council shall consider said report as early as practicable, and if they approve of the same they shall order the city attorney to draw an ordinance levying the benefits assessed by the board against the various lots or parcels of land with a proper description of the same. Upon the passage of such ordinance the amounts therein named shall become special taxes against the property, shall be a lien thereon, and their collection enforced by advertisement and sale of the property as in the collection of ad valorem taxes: Provided, It shall not be necessary to sell at the same time as for delinquent ad valorem taxes.

All ordinances ordering such improvements must state how the cost of the same must be paid for, and a copy of such ordinance shall be furnished the board of appraisers prior to their assessment of the damages. Alleys through blocks shall be opened entirely at the cost of the owners of the ground in each respective block.

<p>Sec. 144. It shall be sufficient in any case to describe the lot or piece of ground as the same is platted and recorded, although the same may belong to several per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sons; but in case any lot or piece of ground may belong to different persons the owner of any part thereof may pay his proportion of the tax on such lot or piece of ground and his proper share may be determined by the city treasurer.</p>

The city council shall have power to provide for the sale and con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />veyance of any lot or piece of ground for nonpayment of such special taxes and the deeds given to convey the same may be recorded in the office of the register of deeds as other conveyances; the conveyance shall be to the person owning the certificate of sale at the time such conveyance is given: Provided, That any lot or piece of ground may be redeemed within two years after the day of sale or at any time thereafter until the tax deed is issued, by paying to the city treasurer the tax, penalty, costs, and interest at the rate of twenty-five per cent per annum. Lots of land belonging to minors or any interest they may have in any lands sold for special taxes may be redeemed in the same manner at any time before such minor becomes of age and during one year thereafter.</p>

When the ordinance levying the tax makes the same due as the improvement is completed in front of or along any block or piece of ground, then the engineer may accept the same in sections from time to time if founts to be done according to contract, always reporting his acceptance to the city council for confirmation or rejection.</p>
<p>Sec. 147. Special taxes shall be a lien on the lots and pieces of ground subject to the same from the time the amount thereof shall have been ascertained, and in case any error or irregularity should occur in levying or collecting any such special tax proceedings may be taken anew so as to obviate any such error or irregularity.</p>

<salute>An Act to amend section 116 of the charter of the city of Galveston.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas:</p>
<p>Section 1. That section 116 of the charter of the city of Galveston be amended so as to hereafter read as follows:</p>
<p>Section 116. There shall be and is hereby created a board called the commissioners of water works, to consist of five members, to be ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pointed by the mayor and confirmed by the city council, who shall hold their offices for the term of four years and until their successors are duly elected and qualified, except as hereinafter prescribed. Said commissioners shall be en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />titled to receive such salary as the city council may determine, not to exceed three hundred dollars each per annum payable quarterly. The mayor with the approval of the city council shall have the power to remove any commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioner for cause and to fill any vacancy occuring in said office either from death,<pb n="1321" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="95" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>resignation, removal from office, removal from the city, or other cause. All ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pointments to fill vacancies shall be for the unexpired term. No person shall be eligible to the office of commissioner unless he be thirty years of age, a freeholder, and qualified voter in said city. The mayor shall on the first Monday in July, 1887, or as soon thereafter as practicable, appoint the five commissioners provided for in this act, and said commissioners shall hold their offices two of them for two years and three of them for four years from date of appointment. The mayor shall issue commissions to the persons so appointed, designating the terms for which they are severally appointed, and whenever the term of office of any commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioner expires the appointment of his successor shall be for four years. Said com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioners shall take the oath of office required of other officers of said city and give bond for the faithful performance of their duties payable to the city of Gal<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />veston in the sum of ten thousand dollars, to be approved by the committee on finance and revenue of the city council. Upon the appointment and qualification of the commissioners, they shall organize by the election of a president from among their own number and appoint a secretary with such a salary as they may pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />scribe, and a majority of the commissioners shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. They shall advertise and let contracts for the construction of a system of water works according to plans and specifications to be adopted by them; but all contracts shall be subject to the approval of the city council and shall be signed by the mayor and countersigned by the city clerk before the same take effect. Any contract made under the provisions of this section shall state the source of water supply, the location, capacity, and plan of the main reservoir, the location, capacity, and plan of all standpipes and reservoirs in the city, and the location, size, number, and material of all hydrants. Any contract made under this act for the construction of water works shall be paid for by the city with the proceeds of the five per cent forty-year bonds issued for the purpose of con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />structing water works and by funds set apart for that purpose by the city council in its annual budget. For the purpose of obtaining information and paying their necessary expenses and the expenses of a competent engineer for consulting and advisory purposes, said board is hereby authorized to expend the sum of ten thou<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sand dollars or so much thereof as may be necessary, to be paid by the city coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cil out of the proceeds of sales of bonds to be issued for the construction of water works. The water works, including the collection of water rates, tolls, and rev<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />enues, shall be under the control, management, and administration of the board of commissioners. The board shall appoint all officers, agents, and employees that may be necessary for the efficient operation of said water works and prescribe their duties, salaries, and compensation. The board shall adopt rules and regulations for the management of the water works, and shall have authority to remove or suspend any officer, agent, or employee of said department. The board shall have authority to do all work and repairs, purchase all material and sup<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />plies, and employ all labor necessary for the efficient operation of the water works; but all contracts involving the expenditure of a sum exceeding one thousand dol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lars, except for operating expenses, shall be submitted to the city coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cil for their approval. Whenever the city council shall by ordinance provide for the extension of the system of water works along the streets and alleys not supplied in the original plan of the water works, it shall be the duty of the board to contract for the construction of the same in the man<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ner hereinbefore provided, subject to the approval of the city council. The board shall fix and establish a schedule of water rates and tolls and provide the mode and manner of the construction of service pipes and their connection with<pb n="1322" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="96" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>the water mains. The board, shall collect all water rates, tolls, and revenues and pay the same into the treasury at the end of each week, which shall constitute a special fund to be used for the benefit of the water works and the payment and redemption of the bonds issued for their construction. The city council shall pass all ordinances necessary for the protection and preservation of the water works. The board shall keep a record of their proceedings in a well bound book kept for that purpose; they shall keep a regular set of books showing in detail the business transactions of the board, and shall report to the city council at the beginning of each month the transactions of the preceding month, including a pay roll of its officers, agents, and employees, and a correct account of all collections, purchases, expenditures, and approved claims entitled to payment, which report shall be re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ferred to the committee on finance and revenue of the city council, Whose duty it shall be to examine and report on same; and for this purpose said committee shall have the right at all times to inspect and examine the records, papers, and books of the board of water commissioners.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. Whereas the legislature is nearing adjournment, and whereas it is im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />portant that the water works system of the city of Galveston should be placed under the Control and management of a board of commissioners, therefore an im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />perative public necessity and emergency exists requiring that the rule requiring all bills to be read on three several days be suspended and that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is therefore enacted that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage.</p>

Such amount collected shall be credited on the certificates already issued against abutting prop<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erty, and the city council shall by ordinance provide the form and manner of col<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lecting and disbursing the same. Before any railroad or street railway company shall be permitted to occupy such improved street or portion of street it shall file with the city secretary in writing an acceptance of the terms on which its occu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pancy of the same shall be permitted as may be provided in said ordinance. The city council shall have power to provide by ordinance for the laying out of drain<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />age and sewerage districts and to provide for the cost of constructing main and lateral drains in such districts by assessment against the owner or owners of the lots, blocks, or tracts of land when not laid out in blocks and lots, within such district, according to the number of feet of frontage on the street within such dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />trict as is the case of sidewalks and street improvements, and may provide that such additional proportion of the cost of main sewers or drains, shall be assessed against the property abutting upon the street or streets through which such main sewers or drains may be constructed as they may deem just and equitable; and main sewers and drains may be constructed and the cost of the same assessed against on the land within such district in contemplation of lateral or cross sewers or drains being constructed within such district at some future time. Nothing in this act shall be construed to prevent the city council from constructing sewers and drains or making street improvements in whole or in part at the expense of the city should it be deemed advisable so to do by the said city council: Provided, That such sewers shall be made of vitrified pipe or other lasting material of like character not less than six inches nor more than twenty-four inches in diameter.</p>
<p>Section 23b. After the passage of the resolution referred to in the next preceding section it shall be the duty of the city council to have the same advertised for not less than four days in some newspaper published in the city of Houston, and no further action in regard to the proposed improvement stated in said resolution shall be taken until after the lapse of ten days from the first publication thereof. Should parties owning property having in the aggregate a minority of the feet frontage on the street or portion of street to be paved or on which sidewalks are to be constructed as stated in said resolution be dissatisfied with the proposed mate<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rial to be used in constructing such improvements as stated in said resolution and shall affix their signatures, with the number of feet frontage owned by each re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />spectively, to a document stating the material agreed upon and desired by them to be used in constructing such improvement, it shall be the duty of the city<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />council to amend said resolution and make it conform to the wishes of such majority of property owners, and the specifications and plans prepared shall be in harmony with said resolution as thus amended. The city council shall be exclusive judges in determining whether or not any change relating to the material to be used is desired by parties owning property having in the aggre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gate a majority of the feet frontage on the street or portion of the street to be improved, and their decision of the matter shall be final and conclusive, nor shall such decision in any way affect the validity of assessments made under such resolution. After the passage of such resolution referred to above, it<pb n="1328" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="102" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>shall be the duty of the mayor to have the necessary plans and specifications for such improvement prepared by the city engineer in accordance with the terms of said resolution, which plans and specifications when prepared and adopted by the city council shall be filed for public inspection in the office of the city secretary : Provided, however, That should the city have a board of public works they shall be consulted and advised with in the preparation of said plans and specifications and they shall report upon the same to the city council before the same are approved by the council. After said plans and specifications shall have been approved bids for the construction of such improvements shall be solicited by advertisements duly made, which advertisements shall refer to said plans and specifications on file as aforesaid, and shall state whether said improvements are to be paid for in whole or in part in cash in improvement certificates, as shall have been previously determined by city council.</p>
<p>Section 23c. After the bid for the construction of sidewalk, street, drainage, or sewerage improvements shall have been accepted by the council, and a contract for the construction of the same shall have been entered into, it shall be the duty of the mayor as the work progresses to cause to be prepared by the city engineer a roll or rolls showing the number of lots and blocks, or names of the tracts of land when not divided into lots, fronting on such street, alley, or avenue to be improved, and in case of sewerage or drainage improvements within the district provided for the names of the owner or owners of each lot, part lot, block, or tract of land, if known, and if unknown it shall be so stated, the number frontage of each lot, part lot, block, or tract of land, and the total cost of such improvement necessary to be borne by each and to be paid for by each owner of such property described in such rolls, the correctness of said roll or rolls shall be certified to by the city engineer and by the board of public works should such board be created, and the same shall be filed in the office of the city secretary and treasurer for public inspec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion. If owing to the shape of any block or blocks or to the angle of any street, or for any reason whatsoever, it shall be deemed by the city council impracticable or inequitable to assess the cost of streets, sidewalks, drainage, or sewerage improve<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments in the manner precisely as provided for in this act, then the same shall ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />portion in such manner as in the opinion of said city council will conform most nearly to the spirit and interest [intent] of the provisions of this act; and their apportionment of the same in any event, as shown by the roll of ownership and their final approval of said roll, shall be conclusive.</p>
<p>Section 23d. On the filing of said roll or rolls in the office of the city secretary and treasurer, it shall be the duty of the mayor to cause to be published for not less than four days in some daily newspaper published in the city of Houston a notice in form substantially as follows: &#8220;Persons owning property on (here insert the name of the street or streets or portions of the same described in or referred to in said roll) are hereby notified that the rolls of ownership showing the amount of the special assessment levied against the owners of the property on the above named streets to cover the cost of improvements made in accordance with the reso<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lutions of the council adopted (here insert the date of the resolution) are on file in the office of the city secretary for inspection in order that all persons interested therein or to be affected thereby may have an opportunity of calling the attention of the city council to any errors or mistakes connected with such assessments levied against property owned by them as shown by said rolls.&#8221; The publication of such resolutions together with the advertisement for said bids and the publi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cation of said notice next above referred to shall be notice to all persons own<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="1329" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="103" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>ing property against which any special assessment for sidewalk, street, drainage, or sewerage improvement may be made of the pendency of the proceedings had and to be had and acts taken and to be taken in reference to the same, and such persons shall be permitted after the publication of said resolution and previous to the final approval of said rolls by the city council by petition to the city council filed with the city secretary and treasurer to object to any such acts and proceed<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ings and to show wherein they have been wronged or injured thereby and to ask for the recision or correction of the same, and they shall be permitted to appear in person or by attorney before said council and to obtain redress for such wrongs or injury as they may point out and establish to the satisfaction of said council, nor shall such roll be finally approved by the city council after the filing of such petition by any property owned so affected or liable to be affected by the same until such petition shall have been acted upon by the city council. On the filing of said rolls in the office of said city secretary for public inspection as aforesaid, it shall be the duty of the city secretary to mail a copy of said notice to the postoffice ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dress so far as known to him of all persons whose names appear on said roll.

<p>Section 23e. The sum assessed against each separate tract of land described in said assessment roll shall be divided, except in the case of sidewalk, sewerage, or drainage improvements, into five annual installments. The first of said install<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments shall become due when the work on each respective block or tract of land referred to in said roll, to pay for which the assessment is levied, shall have been completed and accepted by the city, and one of each of the remaining installments shall become due on a certain day in each year therefor. On each of the respective days last referred to the entire interest on the whole amount of the principal then unpaid shall also become due. The entire amount assessed against each tract of land shall bear interest from the date of the acceptance of the work at the rate of eight per cent per annum until maturity, and each installment shall bear interest at the rate of ten per cent per annum after the maturity of the same. Failure to pay any two installments of principal and interest when due shall cause subsequent installments of principal to mature and become due and authorize a foreclosure of the lien for all installments of principal unpaid, together with the collection of ten per cent attorney&#8217;s fees, after demand for payment shall have been made. After said roll of ownership shall have been finally approved by the city council, it shall be the duty of the city secretary to divide the sum assessed against each separate tract of land described in such roll by the number of installments provided for and to add to each installment the amount of interest annually to become due on the entire amount of the principal unpaid at the maturity of each installment, which sum shall be the amount of principal and interest due for each year respectively on such tract of land; and he shall preserve as an archive of his office a roll showing the result of such calculation, and the same shall be labeled and filed by him with the date of such filing indorsed thereon.</p>

Such certificate shall also show that said amount named therein is payable in equal annual installments, naming the number of such installments, the date when the first installment be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />comes due, and that one of each remaining installments will become due on the same day of each year thereafter until all are due, and that the entire amount of principal at any time unpaid hears interest from the date of the certificate at the rate of eight per cent per annum until maturity, and that each installment of prin<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cipal will bear interest at the rate of ten per cent per annum after maturity of the same, and that failure to pay any two installments of principal when due with interest then due will cause all subsequent installments of principal to mature and become due, and authorize a foreclosure of the lien for all installments of principal unpaid, together with the collection of a penalty of ten per cent for attorney&#8217;s fees, after demand for payment shall have been made. There shall also be attached to said certificate as many coupons as there are installments of principal and interest provided for in the same, each of which coupons shall show the date of such certi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ficate, the date when such coupon is due, the amount of principal represented by the coupons, the amount of interest represented by the same, and the total amount of such principal. Such certificates when so issued shall be prima facie evidence that all prerequisites required by law pertaining to the levying of said assessment and the issuance and delivery of said certificates have been complied with, and the same shall be assignable in such manner as the city council may direct. Such cer<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tificates may be delivered to the contractor or person entitled to receive the same. Should the property owner fail to pay the amount of said certificate when the same becomes due, or when any installment provided for in the same becomes due, the owner thereof may institute suit for the enforcement of the tax and the foreclosure of the lien provided for in any court having jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Section 23g.

</opener>
<p>Whereas under an act of the legislature of the state of Texas, approved July 21, 1870, certain settlers on the Milam County school lands, located in Hood County, bought their pre-emption claims from the state of Texas at the rate of fifty cents per acre, and received patents therefor from the state; and whereas the supreme court has declared said law unconstitutional and said patents void; and whereas the said settlers, or their assigns, have lost said lands at the suit of Milam County, and said parties have given notice of their intention to apply for relief at the hands of the Twenty-first Legislature, and ask to be reimbursed in their purchase money with lawful interest:</p>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That upon proper proof being made to the comptroller of public accounts that the said settlers, or their assigns, who then owned and paid for said pre-emption surveys and lost the same through the courts of this state, that the said comptroller is authorized and ordered to draw a warrant on the state treasurer in favor of each of said settlers, or his assigns, for the amount or amounts paid by him to the state for said pre-emption claims.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. That the sum of fifteen hundred dollars, or so much thereof as may be necessary, be appropriated out of the general revenue not otherwise appropriated to pay the same.</p>

The collec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tor shall have full power to levy upon any personal property to satisfy any tax imposed by this act. All taxes shall be a lien upon the property upon which they are assessed, and if taxes are not paid on or before the time prescribed by the ordinances of said city the same shall from such time bear interest at the rate of (8) eight per centum per annum till paid, which interest shall be collected by the collector at the time and in the manner provided herein for the collection of taxes: and in case any property levied upon is about to be removed out of the city the collector shall proceed to take into his possession so much thereof as will pay the taxes assessed and costs of collection. If from any cause the sale of the property levied upon or seized for taxes shall not take place at the time ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pointed, the collector shall appoint some other time, giving the like notice, and proceed to sell such property in the manner prescribed in the first instance; and in case said property or any part thereof levied upon or seized for taxes cannot be sold on the day advertised such sale may be postponed from day to day until completed, of which postponement the collector shall give verbal notice at the expiration of sale each day. No sale shall be considered complete until the pay<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of the purchase money, and if the same is not paid before the completion of such tax sales the collector shall resell the property and continue such sale until same is complete. Should the collector of taxes fail to make sale of any real estate or personal property for want of a purchaser he shall bid the same off to the city for taxes, interest, penalties, and all costs accruing thereupon, and thereupon the city shall receive in the corporate name a deed for said property, and shall be vested with the same rights as other purchasers at such sales, and shall have power to sell and convey the same, and one deed shall include all parcels of land or lots hid off to the city in any one day at such tax sale. And after sale and purchase by the city of any real estate it shall not be lawful for said collector to levy upon or advertise or sell the same for any remaining or accrued taxes due thereon until the same shall have been redeemed by the owner or is sold by the city.</p>
